          I started out with a terrible idea that probably wouldn't get done
          in time.

      <h2>DAY ONE: How Am I Going To Do This?</h2>
      <p>
        Got some family commitments this weekend, gonna be tricky to fit in
        multi-hour print jobs.  Gotta keep things simple for a change. Main
        thing to keep in mind is to budget <em>about an hour</em> print time for
        each inch of "boundig box" for your print. In other words, something
        6 inches across would take about six hours.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I Teach A Lamp to Fly?</h3>
      <p>
        If I take my airfoils and rotate them into a hoop, I'd have something
        like a jet engine.  I could have a 3d-printed hub in the middle to hold
        the "turbine blades" .... time to sketch.  Ok, I can print a ton of thin
        cardboard symmetrical airfoils simialr to Homework 2.  If I can figure
        out how to score my spars so they bend into a hoop -- or, use
        strategically-flimsy material, I'll have my jet engine. Some rigid
        mateiral in a cross could keep the hoop together. A cone-saped "spinner"
        would be a good 3d print.
      </p>

      <h3>Making the Fan Face .. with a Twist</h3>
      <p>
        To really make it look like a jet engine, I need the front (or top?) of
        the lamp to look like this:

        Ahem, ok. My blades can be simple recantles, laser-cut from twistable
        material. The nose cone could have vertial slots, while the hoop has
        slots at an angle. Or just keep them straight, and the light will
        probalby shine through better.  Probalby stick with no-twist, so I can
        re-use my USPS cardboard and slot measurements from homework 2.

      <h3>How am I Going to Put a Lamp in This Thing?</h3>

        Actually, I should work out the internal structure first. Probably a

    <div id="day-02">
      <h2>DAY TWO: What am I Actually Gonna 3Dprint?</h2>
      <p>
        I have a first-world problem. My lamp actually comes with an adhesive
        mounting system that will work perfectly with my wing ... no 3D printed
        brackts required.
      </p>

      <figure>

        <figcaption>First World Poblem: Don't Need 3D Printed Brakcets</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        What I <em>can</em> do though, is 3Dprint some kind of struts or feet,
        to get my lamp off the desk. Try for a "upper wing of a biplane" look.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic07-sketch05.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Struts, Maybe?</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        So these struts are going to reach up and clip onto the wing.  Maybe
        the thin arifoils;, maybe the thick spars. I'm going to need to 3D
        print a lot testor.  One way would be a simple block with two slots
        cut at right angles. This could form the "head" of the strut that
        clips onto <em>both</em> the airfoil and the spar.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Simple Block with two slots.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Easy to print ... but will I get it right the first time? Maybe I
        should 3D print a version of by gauge. I can make it thiner to use
        less material (and time).  Also, these ideas are coming rapidly
        when I'm away from my sketchbook, so switching to post-its.

      </figure>

      <h3>OK, Let's Form a Plan and Get CADDING!</h3>
      <p>
        Cool, two parts to 3D print and some incremental mods to my Grasshopper
        files. Given the long lead times, I need to sequence things.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>3D Printable Gauge </strong>I'm worried the plastic will behave
          differently from cardboad, and the cardboard slot widths I developed
          won't carry over.  This is a job for a gauge!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Two-slot block </strong>This will validate my slot choice
          before I commit the time & material to a full-on strut.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Struts </strong>Re-use the two-slot block, or maybe  a one-slot
          verison of it. This should be queued up such that all I need to do is
          fine-tune the slot-width before printing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wing Spar with More Slots </strong>A pretty easy mod to last
          week's grashopper code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Airfoil with Lamp-notch Cut Out </strong>Probably penty of
          time for lasercutting while I wait for 3D prints.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Prepping the Gauge in Grasshopper</h3>
      <p>
        Shrunk down my Assingment 2 Gauge down to 1 inch by 0.5 in. Besides the
        input siders I used last week, I had "configuration sliders" stashed
        around to control overall gauge width and height, as well as the size of
        THE NOTCH. Parameterization is starting to pay off.
      </p>

          Original Gauge (left), Resized Gauage (center), Rectangle controls (right).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        By selecting an element <em>upstream</em> of my original output, I can
        bake one gauge instead of two.
      </p>

      <h3>Making it 3D in Rhino</h3>
      <p>
        Extrude and cap seemed ok, but I'm worried about how it's rendering
        hopefully just a wierd artifact with my VM's virtual graphics card.

      <h3>Bringing it into Dremel</h3>
      <p>
        Tried Dremel, couldn't see anything. Tried Contangent, it prompted me to
        convert mm to inches, then looked fine.

  <h3>Getting Dremel To Work</h3>

    Had trouble runing Dremel last night, but got it going today. Looks like
    my 3D Gauge works there too.  Somewhere along the line I had to do a mm to
    inches conversion; need to remember where that happened.

  <h3>Reading the Actual Assingment</h3>
  <p>
    Turns out use of glue is forbidden, so I really shouldn't use that
    self-adhesive bracket that came with with my lamp-guts. Gonna need to
    develop a bracket-thingy after all.

  <h3>Made it to the MILL. Let's Print Something</h3>
  <p>
    My Dremel DigiLab pic from last night says my gauge is going to be 12.7 x
    38.1 x 5.1 mm big. The thinner it is, the faster it will print. Checking a
    3D Print Test Piece in the MILL, I'm seeing 3mm as a baseline thickness
    (below.)  I'll call it 5mm close enough and start printing.

<p>
  Opened in Dremel DigiLab agaain, chose orientation then Lay Flat, with Snap
Rotation turned on.

Go to printer, start with Level. Got prompted to turn a couple knobs.

Go through the change filament procedure.  Good thing I did, I can see how it
purges the old material from the nozzle.

Selected PLA as filament type.
Set nozzle temp to 235 per slack instructions, all other settings left as
default.

Got some kind of warning that says Exteruder range 190-230 all I can do is click
Accept.  Ah, back at filament settings, pull the nozle temp down to 230.

Clicking Build now.

Can't find where to transfer files from USB onto printer.  Found an option to
pre-heat .... aaaaand. now I'm stuck until pre-heat finishes.

Gotta apply glue, hope the bed istn't too hot.

Ah, found the MILL Dremel 3D45 Ideamaker checklist ... the machine <em>will</em>
copy files from my USB. 
</p>

<p>
    <em>
     I think I have a printable object, but not sure if the workflow is repeatble,
     and I think it should be thinner so it will print faster.  Hey wait a sec.
