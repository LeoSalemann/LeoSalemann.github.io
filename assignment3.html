          I started out with a terrible idea that probably wouldn't get done

      <h2>DAY ONE: How Am I Going To Do This?</h2>
      <p>
        Got some family commitments this weekend, gonna be tricky to fit in
        multi-hour print jobs.  Gotta keep things simple for a change. Main
        thing to keep in mind is to budget <em>about an hour</em> print time for
        each inch of "boundig box" for your print. In other words, something
        6 inches across would take about six hours.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I Teach A Lamp to Fly?</h3>
      <p>
        If I take my airfoils and rotate them into a hoop, I'd have something
        like a jet engine.  I could have a 3d-printed hub in the middle to hold
        the "turbine blades" .... time to sketch.  Ok, I can print a ton of thin
        cardboard symmetrical airfoils simialr to Homework 2.  If I can figure
        out how to score my spars so they bend into a hoop -- or, use
        strategically-flimsy material, I'll have my jet engine. Some rigid
        mateiral in a cross could keep the hoop together. A cone-saped "spinner"
        would be a good 3d print.
      </p>

      <h3>Making the Fan Face .. with a Twist</h3>
      <p>
        To really make it look like a jet engine, I need the front (or top?) of
        the lamp to look like this:

        Ahem, ok. My blades can be simple recantles, laser-cut from twistable
        material. The nose cone could have vertial slots, while the hoop has
        slots at an angle. Or just keep them straight, and the light will
        probalby shine through better.  Probalby stick with no-twist, so I can
        re-use my USPS cardboard and slot measurements from homework 2.

      <h2>DAY TWO: What am I Actually Gonna 3Dprint?</h2>
      <p>
        I have a first-world problem. My lamp actually comes with an adhesive
        mounting system that will work perfectly with my wing ... no 3D printed
        brackts required.
      </p>

        <figcaption>First World Poblem: Don't Need 3D Printed Brakcets</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        What I <em>can</em> do though, is 3Dprint some kind of struts or feet,
        to get my lamp off the desk. Try for a "upper wing of a biplane" look.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic07-sketch05.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Struts, Maybe?</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        So these struts are going to reach up and clip onto the wing.  Maybe
        the thin arifoils;, maybe the thick spars. I'm going to need to 3D
        print a lot testor.  One way would be a simple block with two slots
        cut at right angles. This could form the "head" of the strut that
        clips onto <em>both</em> the airfoil and the spar.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Simple Block with two slots.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Easy to print ... but will I get it right the first time? Maybe I
        should 3D print a version of by gauge. I can make it thiner to use
        less material (and time).  Also, these ideas are coming rapidly
        when I'm away from my sketchbook, so switching to post-its.

      </figure>

      <h3>OK, Let's Form a Plan and Get CADDING!</h3>
      <p>
        Cool, two parts to 3D print and some incremental mods to my Grasshopper
        files. Given the long lead times, I need to sequence things.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>3D Printable Gauge </strong>I'm worried the plastic will behave
          differently from cardboad, and the cardboard slot widths I developed
          won't carry over.  This is a job for a gauge!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Two-slot block </strong>This will validate my slot choice
          before I commit the time & material to a full-on strut.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Struts </strong>Re-use the two-slot block, or maybe  a one-slot
          verison of it. This should be queued up such that all I need to do is
          fine-tune the slot-width before printing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wing Spar with More Slots </strong>A pretty easy mod to last
          week's grashopper code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Airfoil with Lamp-notch Cut Out </strong>Probably penty of
          time for lasercutting while I wait for 3D prints.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Prepping the Gauge in Grasshopper</h3>
      <p>
        Shrunk down my Assingment 2 Gauge down to 1 inch by 0.5 in. Besides the
        input siders I used last week, I had "configuration sliders" stashed
        around to control overall gauge width and height, as well as the size of
        THE NOTCH. Parameterization is starting to pay off.
      </p>

          Original Gauge (left), Resized Gauage (center), Rectangle controls (right).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        By selecting an element <em>upstream</em> of my original output, I can
        bake one gauge instead of two.
      </p>

      <h3>Making it 3D in Rhino</h3>
      <p>
        Extrude and cap seemed ok, but I'm worried about how it's rendering
        hopefully just a wierd artifact with my VM's virtual graphics card.

      <h3>Bringing it into Dremel DigiLab</h3>

        convert mm to inches, then looked fine.

  <h3>Getting Dremel DigiLab To Work</h3>
  <p>
    Had trouble runing Dremel DigiLab last night, but got it going today. Looks
    like my 3D Gauge works there too. Looks like I'll need to use Cotangent to
    convert units, then Digilab for the final printing. Maybe I could print
    through Cotangent, or do unit conversion with DigiLab, but right now I'm in
    a mood to go with any workflow that ... works, not necessarily the leanest
    one.

  <h3>Reading the Actual Assingment</h3>
  <p>
    Turns out use of glue is forbidden, so I really shouldn't use that
    self-adhesive bracket that came with with my lamp-guts. Gonna need to
    develop a bracket-thingy after all.

  <h3>Made it to the MILL. Let's Print Something</h3>
  <p>
    My Dremel DigiLab pic from last night says my gauge is going to be 12.7 x
    38.1 x 5.1 mm big. The thinner it is, the faster it will print. Checking a
    3D Print Test Piece in the MILL, I'm seeing 3mm as a baseline thickness
    (below.)  I'll call it 5mm close enough and start printing.

  <p>
    Go through the change filament procedure.  Good thing I did, I can see how it
    purges the old material from the nozzle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Selected PLA as filament type. Set nozzle temp to 235 per slack
    instructions, all other settings left as default.
  </p>
  <p>
    Got some kind of warning that says Extruder range 190-230 all I can do is
    click  <strong>Accept</strong>.  Ah, back at filament settings, pull the
    nozle temp down to 230. (Later on, Jo Jo let me know you can go into custom
    settings to get past 230 on nozzle temparture)
  </p>
  <p>
    Clicking <strong>Build</strong> now. Can't find where to transfer files from USB onto printer.  Found an option to
    pre-heat .... aaaaand. now I'm stuck until pre-heat finishes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gotta apply glue, hope the bed istn't too hot.

    Ah, found the MILL Dremel 3D45 Ideamaker checklist ... the machine <em>will</em>
    copy files from my USB.

    Exited out of the pre-heat.  Started an actual print ... nothing. Wrong
    file format? Object too small?  Back to DigiLab sofware.

    Okay ... the MILL checklist says to use .g3drem files instead of gcode.
    So .... how do I convert?

    Talked to MILL staff, they saidswitch to 3D40 instead of 3D45.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing seem to be coming out, nozzle temperature was too slow, so I hope that the build.
    Went back to filament then, view filament settings nozzle Tim says 230 like I wanted. Try to 35. Still for bidden, extra range stops at 230

    Going to preheat, and try purging the nozzle.

    Purge isn’t doing anything, trey change filament.  Still nothing coming out.

    Got help from JO jail, she had me use a new printer

    Had to scrape the platform clean
    Re-do the leveling process

  <h3>SUCCESS!! I HAVE A 3D GAUGE<h3>

    <h3>Laser Cut a Cardboard Vesion</h3>
    <p>
      Used 25 speed, hundred power, hundred frequencyAlso set document size to 21 x 15.5
    </p>

    <p>
      Like the 3D printed one, the tightest slot is the only one that works.  The
      differences is, the lascercut slot is noticably looser than the 3d-printed -
      it just barely holds. Temted to do another round, taking the tightest slot and
      making it my new middle.
