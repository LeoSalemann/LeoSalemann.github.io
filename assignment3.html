          Then I came up with something achievable in my limited time this week.

      <h2>DAY ONE: How Am I Going To Do This?</h2>
      <p>
        Got some family commitments this weekend, gonna be tricky to fit in
        multi-hour print jobs.  Gotta keep things simple for a change. Main
        thing to keep in mind is to budget <em>about an hour</em> print time for
        each inch of "boundig box" for your print. In other words, something
        6 inches across would take about six hours.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I Teach A Lamp to Fly?</h3>
      <p>
        If I take my airfoils and rotate them into a hoop, I'd have something
        like a jet engine.  I could have a 3d-printed hub in the middle to hold
        the "turbine blades" .... time to sketch.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic01-sketch01.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>I might be on to something.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Ok, I can print a ton of thin
        cardboard symmetrical airfoils simialr to Homework 2.  If I can figure
        out how to score my spars so they bend into a hoop -- or, use
        strategically-flimsy material, I'll have my jet engine. Some rigid
        mateiral in a cross could keep the hoop together. A cone-saped "spinner"
        would be a good 3d print.
      </p>

      <h3>Making the Fan Face .. with a Twist</h3>
      <p>
        To really make it look like a jet engine, I need the front (or top?) of
        the lamp to look like this:
      </p>

        Ahem, ok. My blades can be simple rectangles, laser-cut from twistable
        material. The nose cone could have vertial slots, while the hoop has
        slots at an angle. Or just keep them straight, and the light will
        probalby shine through better.  Probalby stick with no-twist, so I can
        re-use my USPS cardboard and slot measurements from Assignment 2.

    <!-- ***************  DAY TWO  *************** -->
    <div id="day-02">
      <h2>DAY TWO: What am I Actually Gonna 3D Print?</h2>
      <p>
        I have a first-world problem. My lamp actually comes with an adhesive
        mounting system that will work perfectly with my wing ... no 3D printed
        brackets required.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic06-wing-lamp-mounting.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>First World Poblem: Don't Need 3D Printed Brakcets</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        What I <em>can</em> do though, is 3D Print some kind of struts or feet,
        to get my lamp off the desk. Try for a "upper wing of a biplane" look.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic07-sketch05.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Struts, Maybe?</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        So these struts are going to reach up and clip onto the wing.  Maybe
        the thin arifoils; maybe the thick spars. I'm going to need to 3D
        print a slot tester.  One way would be a simple block with two slots
        cut at right angles. This could form the "head" of the strut that
        clips onto <em>both</em> the airfoil and the spar.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic07-sketch06.png" width=200>
        <figcaption>Simple Block with two slots.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Easy to print ... but will I get it right the first time? Maybe I
        should 3D print a version of by gauge. I can make it thiner to use
        less material (and time).  Also, these ideas are coming rapidly
        when I'm away from my sketchbook, so switching to post-its.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h3>OK, Let's Form a Plan and Get CADDING!</h3>
      <p>
        Cool, two parts to 3D print and some incremental mods to my Grasshopper
        files. Given the long lead times, I need to sequence things.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>3D Printable Gauge </strong>I'm worried the plastic will behave
          differently from cardboad, and the cardboard slot widths I developed
          won't carry over.  This is a job for a gauge!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Two-slot block </strong>This will validate my slot choice
          before I commit the time & material to a full-on strut.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Struts </strong>Re-use the two-slot block, or maybe  a one-slot
          verison of it. This should be queued up such that all I need to do is
          fine-tune the slot-width before printing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wing Spar with More Slots </strong>A pretty easy mod to last
          week's grashopper code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Airfoil with Lamp-notch Cut Out </strong>Probably plenty of
          time for lasercutting while I wait for 3D prints.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Prepping the Gauge in Grasshopper</h3>
      <p>
        Shrunk down my Assingment 2 Gauge down to 1 inch by 0.5 in. Besides the
        input siders I used last week, I had "configuration sliders" stashed
        around to control overall gauge width and height, as well as the size of
        THE NOTCH. Parameterization is starting to pay off.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic09-guage-for-3D.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>
          Original Gauge (left), Resized Gauage (center), Rectangle controls (right).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        By selecting an element <em>upstream</em> of my original output, I can
        bake one gauge instead of two.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h3>Making it 3D in Rhino</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Extrude</strong> and <strong>Cap</strong> seemed ok, but I'm
        worried about how it's rendering hopefully just a wierd artifact with
        my VM's virtual graphics card.

      <h3>Bringing it into Dremel DigiLab</h3>
      <p>
        Tried Dremel DigiLab, couldn't see anything. Tried Contangent, it prompted me to
        convert mm to inches, then looked fine.

    <h3>Getting Dremel DigiLab To Work</h3>
    <p>
      Had trouble runing Dremel DigiLab last night, but got it going today. Looks
      like my 3D Gauge works there too. Looks like I'll need to use Cotangent to
      convert units, then Digilab for the final printing. Maybe I could print
      through Cotangent, or do unit conversion with DigiLab, but right now I'm in
      a mood to go with any workflow that ... works, not necessarily the leanest
      one.

    <h3>Reading the Actual Assingment</h3>
    <p>
      Turns out use of glue is forbidden, so I really shouldn't use that
      self-adhesive bracket that came with with my lamp-guts. Gonna need to
      develop a bracket-thingy after all.

    <h3>Made it to the MILL. Let's Print Something</h3>
    <p>
      My Dremel DigiLab pic from last night says my gauge is going to be 12.7 x
      38.1 x 5.1 mm big. The thinner it is, the faster it will print. Checking a
      3D Print Test Piece in the MILL, I'm seeing 3mm as a baseline thickness
      (below.)  I'll call 5mm close enough and start printing.

      Opened my 3D gauge in Dremel DigiLab again, chose <strong>Orientation</strong>
      then <strong>Lay Flat</strong>, with <strong>Snap Rotation</strong> turned on.

      <figcaption>Leveling</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Go through the change filament procedure.  Good thing I did, I can see how it
      purges the old material from the nozzle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Selected PLA as filament type. Set nozzle temp to 235 per slack
      instructions, all other settings left as default. Got some kind of warning
      that says Extruder range 190-230. All I can do is click  <strong>Accept</strong>.
      Ah, back at filament settings, pull the nozzle temp down to 230. Later on,
      Jo Jo let me know you can go into custom settings to get past 230 on nozzle
      temperture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clicking <strong>Build</strong> now. Can't find where to transfer files from
      USB onto printer.  Check the <strong>Tools</strong> page. Found an option to
      <strong>Pre-Heat.</strong> Seems like a good thing to kick off while I
      continue figuring out how to copy form USB.... aaaaand ..  now I'm stuck
      until pre-heat finishes.

    <p>
      Also gotta apply glue, hope the bed istn't too hot.  Nope, we're good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ah, found the MILL Dremel 3D45 Ideamaker checklist. The machine <em>will</em>
      copy files from my USB.  Pre-heat seems to still be pre-heating ...
    </p>

    <p>
      Exit (i.e. gentle rage-quit) out of pre-heat, start an actual print ...
      nothing. Wrong file format? Object too small?  Back to DigiLab software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Okay ... the MILL checklist says to use .g3drem files instead of gcode.
      So .... how do I convert? Talked to MILL staff, they said switch the DigiLab
      software settings to 3D40 instead of 3D45.

    <h3>Now What?</h3>
    <p>
      Nothing seem to be coming out. Nozzle temperature was too low, so I stopped
      the build. Went back to <strong>Filament</strong> on the touch screen,
      then <strong>View Filament Settings.</strong> Nozzle says 230 like I wanted.
      Try 235; still forbidden.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back to preheat, try <strong>Purge Nozzle</strong>.  Purge isn’t doing anything,
      try <strong>Change Filament.</strong>  Still nothing coming out. Got help from
      UW MILL staffer Jo Jo, she had me use a new printer.  Scrape the Build Platform
      clean, Re-do the leveling process, kick off a print, and wait with mild
      anxiety untill ....

    </figure>

    <p>
      Like the 3D printed one, the tightest slot is the only one that works.  The
      differences is, the lascercut slot is noticably looser than the 3d-printed -
      it just barely holds. Tempted to do another round, taking the tightest slot
      and making it my new middle.

    <h2>DAY FIVE: Slots and Bracketry</h2>

    <h3>Where I'm at; What's Next?</h3>
    <p>Okay ... </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I know the optimal slot width for 3d prints.</li>
      <li>I need a better slot width for laser cuts.</li>
      <li>I need some lamp braketry</li>
      <li>I need more spart slots, and airfoils with lamp cut-outs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gearing Up For The Next 3D Print.</h3>
    <p>
      I know the slot thickness I need for 3d printing. I need to measure the
      lamp guts and make the actual bracketry. Forgot my sketch book at home, so
      we're back to post-its.

    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay, now with these dimensions, I can go into Rhino and draw up a couple
      rectangles - one for the main bounding box of the lamp guts, another for
      the rounded "cut-out" in the upper-right corner.   Now is a good time to
      try out

    <h3>Converting to Milimeters</h3>
    <p>
      Hmm ... Dr. Paterson's Airfoil generator requires it. So, re-doing the
      lamp-guts dimensions in mm, I have 30.76 x 16.4.

      <figcaption>Re-measured, in mm. Don't check my math, it's really sloppy.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Using the <strong>Rectangle</strong> comand at the Rhino prompt, I can make
      a rectangle in the exact size I want.  On the Grashopper side, I can fille
      with the NACA inputs to get compatible airfoil shape.

    <p>
      Looks kind of dull, also not sure how the curve of that airofil is really
      going to line up with my lamp guts.  Add another rectangle, tune the NACA
      inputs and ...

    <p>
      The lasercut worked, but to really be an interesting play on light, the
      lamp should be embedded deeper.

      <h3>Hasty Email Notes</h3>
      <p>
        You have the slot thickness you need for the 3-D print. That top notch is
        fully dialed in. You do need to dial in the slot thickness for the postal
        cardboard. So today you’ll need to laser cut at least one more gauge to
        dial in that slot, but any 3-D prints can be using the slot take miss
        you already have.
      </p>
    </em>


    <p>
      So ....
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Start with a trace of the lamp guts.</li>
      <li>Make the hole a bit bigger to account for 3D printer slop.</li>
      <li>Copy & scale up to ma.</li>
      <li>Start with a trace of the lamp guts.</li>
      <li>Start with a trace of the lamp guts.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Hmm.....
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Start with an airfoil and a "bounding rectangle" for the bracket.</li>
      <li>Trim the Rectangle against the airfoil, to establish outer shape of bracket.</li>
      <li>Cut a "hole" to match the lamp-guts.</li>
      <li>Cut a notch for the wing spar. This will use the 3D-print slot thickness. </li>
      <li>Start with a trace of the lamp guts.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You know what? Now that I've thought about this, I'm going to have to work up
      the overal dimensions of the lamp-wing before I do anything.
    </p>

    <h3>Overall Wing-Lamp Dimensions</h3>
    <p>
      Width and length, or Wingspann and Chord if you want to have fun with it.
      Anyhow, using my Assingment 2 wing as a guide, i need a wingspan of 9.5
      inches, about half of the Assingment 2 wing. I could use a thicker airfiol,
      so let's CAD up the boundign rectangle for the lamp guts, and outer rectangle
      for the bracket, and fire up

      </a>


      <p>So the Plan of the Day (POTD) is ... </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lasercut a new gauge with new/smaller slot width</li>
        <li>
          <strong>CAD up a Lamp Braket. </strong> Lasercut first, then 3D print.
          Plan for loose tolerances on the lasercut, which will firm up in the
          3D print.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>More Spar Slots.</strong> A bit of Grashopper work, can be done
          while the lamp braketery are 3d printing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Airfoils with Lamp Cutouts</strong> Best to do after I have 3D
          printed bracketry.
        </li>
      </ol>
