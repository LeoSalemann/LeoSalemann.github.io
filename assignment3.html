      <h2>DAY ONE: How Am I Going To Do This?</h2>
      <p>
        Got some family commitments this weekend, gonna be tricky to fit in
        multi-hour print jobs.  Gotta keep things simple for a change. Main
        thing to keep in mind is to budget <em>about an hour</em> print time for
        each inch of "boundig box" for your print. In other words, something
        6 inches across would take about six hours.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I Teach A Lamp to Fly?</h3>
      <p>
        If I take my airfoils and rotate them into a hoop, I'd have something
        like a jet engine.  I could have a 3d-printed hub in the middle to hold
        the "turbine blades" .... time to sketch.  Ok, I can print a ton of thin
        cardboard symmetrical airfoils simialr to Homework 2.  If I can figure
        out how to score my spars so they bend into a hoop -- or, use
        strategically-flimsy material, I'll have my jet engine. Some rigid
        mateiral in a cross could keep the hoop together. A cone-saped "spinner"
        would be a good 3d print.
      </p>

      <h3>Making the Fan Face .. with a Twist</h3>
      <p>
        To really make it look like a jet engine, I need the front (or top?) of
        the lamp to look like this:

        Ahem, ok. My blades can be simple recantles, laser-cut from twistable
        material. The nose cone could have vertial slots, while the hoop has
        slots at an angle. Or just keep them straight, and the light will
        probalby shine through better.  Probalby stick with no-twist, so I can
        re-use my USPS cardboard and slot measurements from homework 2.

      <h3>How am I Going to Put a Lamp in This Thing?</h3>

        Actually, I should work out the internal structure first. Probably a

    <div id="day-02">
      <h2>DAY TWO: What am I Actually Gonna 3Dprint?</h2>
      <p>
        I have a first-world problem. My lamp actually comes with an adhesive
        mounting system that will work perfectly with my wing ... no 3D printed
        brackts required.
      </p>

      <figure>

        <figcaption>First World Poblem: Don't Need 3D Printed Brakcets</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        What I <em>can</em> do though, is 3Dprint some kind of struts or feet,
        to get my lamp off the desk. Try for a "upper wing of a biplane" look.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic07-sketch05.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Struts, Maybe?</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        So these struts are going to reach up and clip onto the wing.  Maybe
        the thin arifoils;, maybe the thick spars. I'm going to need to 3D
        print a lot testor.  One way would be a simple block with two slots
        cut at right angles. This could form the "head" of the strut that
        clips onto <em>both</em> the airfoil and the spar.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic07-sketch06.png" width=200>
        <figcaption>Simple Block with two slots.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Easy to print ... but will I get it right the first time? Maybe I
        should 3D print a version of by gauge. I can make it thiner to use
        less material (and time).  Also, these ideas are coming rapidly
        when I'm away from my sketchbook, so switching to post-its.

        <figcaption>Simple Block with two slots.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>OK, Let's Form a Plan and Get CADDING!</h3>
      <p>
        Cool, two parts to 3D print and some incremental mods to my Grasshopper
        files. Given the long lead times, I need to sequence things.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>3D Printable Gauge </strong>I'm worried the plastic will behave
          differently from cardboad, and the cardboard slot widths I developed
          won't carry over.  This is a job for a gauge!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Two-slot block </strong>This will validate my slot choice
          before I commit the time & material to a full-on strut.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Struts </strong>Re-use the two-slot block, or maybe  a one-slot
          verison of it. This should be queued up such that all I need to do is
          fine-tune the slot-width before printing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wing Spar with More Slots </strong>A pretty easy mod to last
          week's grashopper code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Airfoil with Lamp-notch Cut Out </strong>Probably penty of
          time for lasercutting while I wait for 3D prints.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Prepping the Gauge in Grasshopper</h3>
      <p>
        Shrunk down my Assingment 2 Gauge down to 1 inch by 0.5 in. Besides the
        input siders I used last week, I had "configuration sliders" stashed
        around to control overall gauge width and height, as well as the size of
        THE NOTCH. Parameterization is starting to pay off.
      </p>

          Original Gauge (left), Resized Gauage (center), Rectangle controls (right).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        By selecting an element <em>upstream</em> of my original output, I can
        bake one gauge instead of two.
      </p>

      <h3>Making it 3D in Rhino</h3>
      <p>
        Extrude and cap seemed ok, but I'm worried about how it's rendering
        hopefully just a wierd artifact with my VM's virtual graphics card.
      </p>

      <h3>Bringing it into Dremel DigiLab</h3>

        convert mm to inches, then looked fine.

  <h3>Getting Dremel DigiLab To Work</h3>
  <p>
    Had trouble runing Dremel DigiLab last night, but got it going today. Looks
    like my 3D Gauge works there too. Looks like I'll need to use Cotangent to
    convert units, then Digilab for the final printing. Maybe I could print
    through Cotangent, or do unit conversion with DigiLab, but right now I'm in
    a mood to go with any workflow that ... works, not necessarily the leanest
    one.

  <h3>Reading the Actual Assingment</h3>
  <p>
    Turns out use of glue is forbidden, so I really shouldn't use that
    self-adhesive bracket that came with with my lamp-guts. Gonna need to
    develop a bracket-thingy after all.

  <h3>Made it to the MILL. Let's Print Something</h3>
  <p>
    My Dremel DigiLab pic from last night says my gauge is going to be 12.7 x
    38.1 x 5.1 mm big. The thinner it is, the faster it will print. Checking a
    3D Print Test Piece in the MILL, I'm seeing 3mm as a baseline thickness
    (below.)  I'll call it 5mm close enough and start printing.
  </p>

    Opened my 3D gauge in Dremel DigiLab again, chose <strong>Orientation</strong>
    then <strong>Lay Flat</strong>, with <strong>Snap Rotation</strong> turned on.

    <figcaption>Leveling</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Go through the change filament procedure.  Good thing I did, I can see how it
    purges the old material from the nozzle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Selected PLA as filament type. Set nozzle temp to 235 per slack
    instructions, all other settings left as default. Got some kind of warning
    that says Extruder range 190-230. All I can do is click  <strong>Accept</strong>.
    Ah, back at filament settings, pull the nozzle temp down to 230. (Later on,
    Jo Jo let me know you can go into custom settings to get past 230 on nozzle
    temparture.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking <strong>Build</strong> now. Can't find where to transfer files from
    USB onto printer.  Found an option to pre-heat .... aaaaand. now I'm stuck
    until pre-heat finishes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gotta apply glue, hope the bed istn't too hot.  Nope, we're good.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah, found the MILL Dremel 3D45 Ideamaker checklist. The machine <em>will</em>
    copy files from my USB.  Pre-heat seems to still be pre-heating ...
  </p>

  <p>
    Exited (i.e. genterl Rage-Quit) out of the pre-heat.  Started an actual
    print ... nothing. Wrong file format? Object too small?  Back to DigiLab
    software.
  </p>

  <h3>Hasty  Notes</h3>

  <p>
    Okay ... the MILL checklist says to use .g3drem files instead of gcode.
    So .... how do I convert? Talked to MILL staff, they said switch the DigiLab
    software settings to 3D40 instead of 3D45.

  <h3>Now What?</h3>
  <p>
    Nothing seem to be coming out, nozzle temperature was too low, so I stopped
    the build. Went back to <strong>Filament</strong> on the touch screen,
    then <strong>View Filament Settings.</strong> Nozzle says 230 like I wanted.
    Try 235; till forbidden.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back to preheat, try <strong>Purge Nozzle</strong>.  Purge isn’t doing anything,
    try <strong>Change Filament.</strong>  Still nothing coming out. Got help from
    UW MILL staffer Jo Jo, she had me use a new printer.  Scrape the Build Platform
    clean, Re-do the leveling process, kick off a print, and wait with mild
    anxiety untill ....

  <h3>Laser Cut a Cardboard Vesion</h3>
  <p>
    Used 25 speed, hundred power, hundred frequencyAlso set document size to 21 x 15.5
  </p>

  <p>
    Like the 3D printed one, the tightest slot is the only one that works.  The
    differences is, the lascercut slot is noticably looser than the 3d-printed -
    it just barely holds. Temted to do another round, taking the tightest slot and
    making it my new middle.

  <h3>Where I'm at; What's Next?</h3>
  <p>Okay ... </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I know the optmal slot-width for 3d prints.</li>
    <li>I need a better slotwith for laser cuts.</li>
    <li>I need some lamp braketry</li>
    <li>I need more spart slots, and airfoils with lamp cut-outs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So the Plan of the Day (POTD) is ... </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Lasercut a new gauge with new/smaller slot width</li>
    <li>
      <strong>CAD up a Lamp Braket. </strong> Lasercut first, then 3D print.
      Plan for loose tolerances on the lasercut, which will firm up in the
      3D print.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>More Spar Slots.</strong> A bit of Grashopper work, can be done
      while the lamp braketery are 3d printing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Airfoils with Lamp Cutouts</strong> Best to do after I have 3D
      printed bracketry.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Hasty Email Notes</h3>
  <p>
    You have the slot thickness you need for the 3-D print. That top notch is
    fully dialed in. You do need to dial in the slot thickness for the postal
    cardboard. So today you’ll need to laser cut at least one more gauge to
    dial in that slot, but any 3-D prints can be using the slot take miss
    you already have.
