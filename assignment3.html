          I started out with a terrible idea that probably wouldn't get done

      <h2>DAY ONE: How Am I Going To Do This?</h2>
      <p>
        Got some family commitments this weekend, gonna be tricky to fit in
        multi-hour print jobs.  Gotta keep things simple for a change. Main
        thing to keep in mind is to budget <em>about an hour</em> print time for
        each inch of "boundig box" for your print. In other words, something
        6 inches across would take about six hours.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I Teach A Lamp to Fly?</h3>
      <p>
        If I take my airfoils and rotate them into a hoop, I'd have something
        like a jet engine.  I could have a 3d-printed hub in the middle to hold
        the "turbine blades" .... time to sketch.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic01-sketch01.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>I might be on to something.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Ok, I can print a ton of thin
        cardboard symmetrical airfoils simialr to Homework 2.  If I can figure
        out how to score my spars so they bend into a hoop -- or, use
        strategically-flimsy material, I'll have my jet engine. Some rigid
        mateiral in a cross could keep the hoop together. A cone-saped "spinner"
        would be a good 3d print.
      </p>

      <h3>Making the Fan Face .. with a Twist</h3>
      <p>
        To really make it look like a jet engine, I need the front (or top?) of
        the lamp to look like this:
      </p>

        Ahem, ok. My blades can be simple rectangles, laser-cut from twistable
        material. The nose cone could have vertial slots, while the hoop has
        slots at an angle. Or just keep them straight, and the light will
        probalby shine through better.  Probalby stick with no-twist, so I can
        re-use my USPS cardboard and slot measurements from Assignment 2.

        wing.

    <!-- ***************  DAY TWO  *************** -->
    <div id="day-02">
      <h2>DAY TWO: What am I Actually Gonna 3D Print?</h2>
      <p>
        I have a first-world problem. My lamp actually comes with an adhesive
        mounting system that will work perfectly with my wing ... no 3D printed
        brackets required.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic06-wing-lamp-mounting.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>First World Poblem: Don't Need 3D Printed Brakcets</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        What I <em>can</em> do though, is 3D Print some kind of struts or feet,
        to get my lamp off the desk. Try for a "upper wing of a biplane" look.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic07-sketch05.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Struts, Maybe?</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        So these struts are going to reach up and clip onto the wing.  Maybe
        the thin arifoils; maybe the thick spars. I'm going to need to 3D
        print a slot tester.  One way would be a simple block with two slots
        cut at right angles. This could form the "head" of the strut that
        clips onto <em>both</em> the airfoil and the spar.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw03-pic07-sketch06.png" width=200>
        <figcaption>Simple Block with two slots.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Easy to print ... but will I get it right the first time? Maybe I
        should 3D print a version of by gauge. I can make it thiner to use
        less material (and time).  Also, these ideas are coming rapidly
        when I'm away from my sketchbook, so switching to post-its.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Simple Block with two slots.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>OK, Let's Form a Plan and Get CADDING!</h3>
      <p>
        Cool, two parts to 3D print and some incremental mods to my Grasshopper
        files. Given the long lead times, I need to sequence things.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>3D Printable Gauge </strong>I'm worried the plastic will behave
          differently from cardboad, and the cardboard slot widths I developed
          won't carry over.  This is a job for a gauge!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Two-slot block </strong>This will validate my slot choice
          before I commit the time & material to a full-on strut.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Struts </strong>Re-use the two-slot block, or maybe  a one-slot
          verison of it. This should be queued up such that all I need to do is
          fine-tune the slot-width before printing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wing Spar with More Slots </strong>A pretty easy mod to last
          week's grashopper code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Airfoil with Lamp-notch Cut Out </strong>Probably plenty of
          time for lasercutting while I wait for 3D prints.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Prepping the Gauge in Grasshopper</h3>
      <p>
        Shrunk down my Assingment 2 Gauge down to 1 inch by 0.5 in. Besides the
        input siders I used last week, I had "configuration sliders" stashed
        around to control overall gauge width and height, as well as the size of
        THE NOTCH. Parameterization is starting to pay off.
      </p>

      <figure>

        <figcaption>
          Original Gauge (left), Resized Gauage (center), Rectangle controls (right).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        By selecting an element <em>upstream</em> of my original output, I can
        bake one gauge instead of two.
      </p>

      <h3>Making it 3D in Rhino</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Extrude</strong> and <strong>Cap</strong> seemed ok, but I'm
        worried about how it's rendering hopefully just a wierd artifact with
        my VM's virtual graphics card.

      <h3>Bringing it into Dremel DigiLab</h3>

        Tried Dremel DigiLab, couldn't see anything. Tried Contangent, it prompted me to
        convert mm to inches, then looked fine.

      <h3>Getting Dremel DigiLab To Work</h3>
      <p>
        Had trouble runing Dremel DigiLab last night, but got it going today. Looks
        like my 3D Gauge works there too. Looks like I'll need to use Cotangent to
        convert units, then Digilab for the final printing. Maybe I could print
        through Cotangent, or do unit conversion with DigiLab, but right now I'm in
        a mood to go with any workflow that ... works, not necessarily the leanest
        one.

      <h3>Reading the Actual Assingment</h3>
      <p>
        Turns out use of glue is forbidden, so I really shouldn't use that
        self-adhesive bracket that came with with my lamp-guts. Gonna need to
        develop a bracket-thingy after all.

      <h3>Made it to the MILL. Let's Print Something</h3>
      <p>
        My Dremel DigiLab pic from last night says my gauge is going to be 12.7 x
        38.1 x 5.1 mm big. The thinner it is, the faster it will print. Checking a
        3D Print Test Piece in the MILL, I'm seeing 3mm as a baseline thickness
        (below.)  I'll call 5mm close enough and start printing.
      </p>

        Go through the change filament procedure.  Good thing I did, I can see how it
        purges the old material from the nozzle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Selected PLA as filament type. Set nozzle temp to 235 per slack
        instructions, all other settings left as default. Got some kind of warning
        that says Extruder range 190-230. All I can do is click  <strong>Accept</strong>.
        Ah, back at filament settings, pull the nozzle temp down to 230. Later on,
        Jo Jo let me know you can go into custom settings to get past 230 on nozzle
        temperture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clicking <strong>Build</strong> now. Can't find where to transfer files from
        USB onto printer.  Check the <strong>Tools</strong> page. Found an option to
        <strong>Pre-Heat.</strong> Seems like a good thing to kick off while I
        continue figuring out how to copy form USB.... aaaaand ..  now I'm stuck
        until pre-heat finishes.

        Ah, found the MILL Dremel 3D45 Ideamaker checklist. The machine <em>will</em>
        copy files from my USB.  Pre-heat seems to still be pre-heating ...
      </p>

      <p>
        Exit (i.e. gentle rage-quit) out of pre-heat, start an actual print ...
        nothing. Wrong file format? Object too small?  Back to DigiLab software.
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay ... the MILL checklist says to use .g3drem files instead of gcode.
        So .... how do I convert? Talked to MILL staff, they said switch the DigiLab
        software settings to 3D40 instead of 3D45.

      <h3>Now What?</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing seem to be coming out. Nozzle temperature was too low, so I stopped
        the build. Went back to <strong>Filament</strong> on the touch screen,
        then <strong>View Filament Settings.</strong> Nozzle says 230 like I wanted.
        Try 235; still forbidden.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back to preheat, try <strong>Purge Nozzle</strong>.  Purge isn’t doing anything,
        try <strong>Change Filament.</strong>  Still nothing coming out. Got help from
        UW MILL staffer Jo Jo, she had me use a new printer.  Scrape the Build Platform
        clean, Re-do the leveling process, kick off a print, and wait with mild
        anxiety untill ....

      <h3>SUCCESS!! I HAVE A 3D GAUGE!</h3>

        The printer threated it would take 29 hours, but finished in about 45 min.

      <p>
        Like the 3D printed one, the tightest slot is the only one that works.  The
        differences is, the lascercut slot is noticably looser than the 3d-printed -
        it just barely holds. Tempted to do another round, taking the tightest slot
        and making it my new middle.

      <h3>Where I'm at; What's Next?</h3>
      <p>Okay ... </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I know the optimal slot width for 3d prints.</li>
        <li>I need a better slot width for laser cuts.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Gearing Up For The Next 3D Print.</h3>
      <p>
        I know the slot thickness I need for 3d printing. I need to measure the
        lamp guts and make the actual bracketry. Forgot my sketch book at home, so
        we're back to post-its.

        <figcaption>Lamp Guts Dimensions.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, now with these dimensions, I can go into Rhino and draw up a couple
        rectangles - one for the main bounding box of the lamp guts, another for
        the rounded "cut-out" in the upper-right corner.   Now is a good time to
        try out

        <a href ="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/GarethPaterson">Dr. Gareth Paterson's </a>

      </p>

      <h3>Converting to Milimeters</h3>
      <p>
        Hmm ... Dr. Paterson's Airfoil generator requires it. So, re-doing the
        lamp-guts dimensions in mm, I have 30.76 x 16.4.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using the <strong>Rectangle</strong> comand at the Rhino prompt, I can make
        a rectangle in the exact size I want.  On the Grashopper side, I can fille
        with the NACA inputs to get compatible airfoil shape.

        Looks kind of dull, also not sure how the curve of that airofil is really
        going to line up with my lamp guts.  Add another rectangle, tune the NACA

      <p>
        The lasercut worke and fits nicely. But to really be an interesting play on
        light, the lamp should be embedded deeper.
      </p>


      <h3>Back to Sketchbook</h3>
      <p>
        Time to trace, measure, and think again. The rounded corner isn't a single
        readius, more like a flat line with a bend at each end. Looking closer and
        running my fingers over the curve,I think the radius being used to round
        the 90 degree corners might also be used for the diagonal.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, back to Rhino, try some rounding-radii, and eyebal it. Use
        <strong>InsertControlPoint</strong> to add a fith point to the rectangle.
        Move points by left-click and drag. Delete that smaller rectangle. Move
        the reshaped rectangle to a more interesting part of the airfoil. Ended
        up with this:

      <p>
        Sweet! A dozen or so of these "lamp hole" airfoils, a solid one at each
        end, a few spars to hold it all together, and I've got my lamp! The 3D
        printng will come into play as "struts" to lift the wing-lamp off my desk.
      </p>

      <h3>CAD Up Some Struts</h3>
      <p>
        Now that I know what to print, I should CAD it up ASAO, to max out my
        available lead time for printing. I'll stay in the same "inch world" that
        I had with my gauge, since I'll be dependnt on the winning gauge slot.
      </p>

      <h3>Back to the Grashopper Gauge File</h3>
      <p>
        Pull up the gauge generator again.  This time, I just want the rectangle
        for the upper slot.  Find it, bake it into a new clean Rhino file.
      </p>

        Cut the slot into the strut, merge the "foot." <strong>BooleanUnion</strong>
        and <strong>BooleanSplit</strong> seemed to get it done, but it was a bit
        tedious to click and drag the "cutting slot" away from the main strut.
        Kept coming off in bits and pices.

        Export to STL, pull into Cotangent. Hmm, this time, it didn't prompt me to
        convert to inches. Back to Rhino, set both <strong>Layout Units</strong> and
        <strong>Model Units</strong> to inches. Export to STL, load directly into
        Dremel DigiLab.  Doesn't help. More scale-hacking, this seems to have
        worked:

          Go to the "Document Properties" toolbar icon, set both <strong>Layout Units</strong> and
          <strong>Model Units</strong> to inches.
        </li>

        <li>
          Go to the "file" toolbar icon, set  both <strong>Model Units</strong>
          back to milimeters.
        </li>

        <li>
          When prompted to scale model by 25.4, click <strong>Yes.</strong>

      <h3>Let's See if the Printer Plays Nice Today</h3>
      <p>
        Found a printer that said it just completed a build, this is a good sign.
        Start with change filament. Prior film it was the same color, so just
        have to time it right.

      <p>
        Tried custom settings instead of PLA, got the nozzle to 235, but build
        platform temp ended up at 45 isntead of 35. Once the build was underway,
        filament wouldn't stick.
      </p>

      <p>
        No I'm spooked so I'll stick to PLA default settings, changing only the
        nozzl temp to good ol' 230 deg. C. Same value that worked for my gauge.
      </p>

      <p>

      <h3>Queue Up Another 3D Print</h3>
      <p>
        Gotta keep that printer running to manage my lead time. Pretty happy
        with the slot; would be nice if it could be thicker.  Maybe a hotter
        nozzle will make it stronger and look better?
      </p>

      <p>
        Talk with MILL staffers about my bed adherence issues. Livia suggests a
        higher bed temperature.  I'll probably try to crank the nozzle up to 235
        as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        First-off, get back into Rhino, see if I can extrude higher.  Looks like
        I shoudl delete the polysurface, keep the polycurve, and re-extrude.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Also had to go back to Grasshopper and regenerate my rectangle for slot
        cutouts (again).  This time I'll keep the 2D gauge around so it's easier
        to re-use.

      <p>
        Need two copies of the strut for a total of 3. Going to try and do that
        in Dremel DigiLab.  Cool! All ya gotta do is open, move and/or rotate,
        then open again.  Each time you open an STL, you get a new copy of the
        object. At first I wanted to rotate one to get an alternating pattern,
        but it got hard to rotate a perfect 180, so I kept them all facing the
        same direction.

      <p>
        Looks like a 2.5 hour print ... gotta queue this up fast.  This time I'm
        going to use custom filmaent settings instead of PLA defaults. Going for
        235 deg C nozzle and 45 deg C platform. Hoping that will help the filaments
        bond to to eachather for a stronger part and a smoother look.

      <h3>Pivot Back to Lasercutting</h3>
      <p>
        First thing I need is a good slot width. Back to the gauge.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>First off, record my setting before I do anything</strong>
        The settings I have now are crucial to successful 3d-printed slots.
        Copied them all up to the <a href ="#machine-settings"> machine settings</a> section, but
        still feeling paranoid so I made a backup copy of the grashopper file
        as well.

      <p>
        Right, then. Back on <a href = "#day-04">Day Four</a> I discovered my
        smallest slot-width was still too big for USPS cardbaord. So I'll make the
        top width the new middle. <strong>Slot size delta</strong> is subtraced
        from the two numbers above the middle (i.e. caliper) slot, and is added
        to the two bottom ones. eplicate the "slot math" in Google Sheets so
        I can see all the values.
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the Guage through the Bake -> Export -> print workflow that I used
        exhaustivley in Assingment 2. Turns out Slot two is the best fit this time.
        Based on my Google sheet, it's <strong>0.043 inches.</strong>

        <figcaption>Cool! Now How do I convert this into millimeters?</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Inches vs Milimeters</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, I have a good slot width <strong>(0.043 inches)</strong> and a
        wing spar generator that also operates in inches, so I can make a spar
        now. The tricky part is the airfoils -- those are in milimeters. Bath of
        least resistance is probalby just scale my slot by 25.4 when I bake with
        the airofil. One more component on the AIRFOIL SLOT module of the spar
        generator.
      </p>

      <h3>Prepping the Spar Generator</h3>
      <p>
        Let's stay in inches for awhile. Use the slot width I just figured out,
        eyeball a good wingspan based on the size of my led strip, adjust the
        spart height until it looks good. Full parameters are in
        <a href="machine-settings">machine settings</a>, highlights are below.

      <h3>Pivot to Milimeters</h3>
      <p>Should have done this a <em>long</em> time ago. Add a scale component
        to the end of my spar generator. Scale everything by 25.4, the vlaue
        Rhino uses when you mess with Layout and Model Scales to convert inches
        to mm. Bake the output next to my airfoil and hope it all works out.

      <h3>Great, So How do I Build This Thing?</h3>

      <p>
        Earlier builds taught me to line up carefully and be patient with the
        spars.  First, get all the airfoils lined up with one spar on top.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Final Assenbly step 1: Line It Up</figcaption>

      <p>
        Now <em>carefully</em> slide the slots into each other.

      </figure>

      <p>
        So far so good. Flip it over, put it on the edge of the table so you
        <em>don't</em> crush the trailing edges, and line up the second spar.

        <h3>Hasty Email Notes</h3

          <p>
            You have the slot thickness you need for the 3-D print. That top notch is
            fully dialed in. You do need to dial in the slot thickness for the postal
            cardboard. So today you’ll need to laser cut at least one more gauge to
            dial in that slot, but any 3-D prints can be using the slot take miss
            you already have.

          <h3>Overall Wing-Lamp Dimensions</h3>
          <p>
            Width and length, or Wingspann and Chord if you want to have fun with it.
            Anyhow, using my Assingment 2 wing as a guide, i need a wingspan of 9.5
            inches, about half of the Assingment 2 wing. I could use a thicker airfiol,
            so let's CAD up the boundign rectangle for the lamp guts, and outer rectangle
            for the bracket, and fire up

            <ol>
              <li>Lasercut a new gauge with new/smaller slot width</li>
              <li>
                <strong>CAD up a Lamp Braket. </strong> Lasercut first, then 3D print.
                Plan for loose tolerances on the lasercut, which will firm up in the
                3D print.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>More Spar Slots.</strong> A bit of Grashopper work, can be done
                while the lamp braketery are 3d printing.

              <li>
                <strong>Airfoils with Lamp Cutouts</strong> Best to do after I have 3D
