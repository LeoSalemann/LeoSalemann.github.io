    <p>Make a name plat using any fabircation tehnique and material.</p>

    <h2>Coming up with an Idea</h2>
    <p>
      I spent last Saturday (April 6, 2019) at the
      <a href= "https://hfs.uw.edu/Maker-Summit-2019"> UW Maker summit</a>.
      There was lasercutting workshop at
      <a href="https://reg.hfs.uw.edu/Program/GetProducts?productTypeCV=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000003502&classification=3e2e1a82-4f98-473b-b791-30ab7fe14c4c">
        the MILL</a>,
        so I used that as an opportunity to do my homework.
      </p>

      <h2>Finding a Cool Image</h2>
      <p>
        One of my pastimes is browsing aircraft photos on
        <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdWings/">r/WierdWings<a> on
          <a href="www.reddit.com">reddit.</a>  If found an image of a
          <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdWings/comments/b9sd6q/dornier_do_x_in_florida_on_trip_from_germany_to/">
            Dorinier DoX from 1931.</a>
            It's a seaplane that literally looks like a "flying boat."  The image itself is a sepia toned,
            perhaps a daguerreotype, so I thought it would look good burned in wood. The top half
            of the image is mostly empty sky, so if I filled the space with my name in all caps,
            I'd have a good Nameboard.

          <h2> Pickng a font </h2>
          <p>
            It took awhile to find a font that worked well with the image.
            I wanted something with blocky, with some "Olde English flair", but
            still legible. It also had to be mostly solid -- providing good
            contrast and readability at a distance. After looking at
            Castellar, Old English Text MT, GothicE, and Algerian, I went with Algerian.

          <h2> Printing! </h2>
          <p>
            Thank goodness I attended the lasercutting workshop at the MILL.
            I was able to check out a Macbook pro with all the software I needed.
            The staffers got me familiar with Adobe Illustrator and their lasercutters.
            There were several print dialogues with a lot of parameters to get familiar with.
          </p>
          <div class="imgWireFrame">
            <p>
              If I had the presense of mind to grab some screen shots of the
              print dialogues I would have displayed them right here. :/
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The staffers also showed me the lasercutter joystick/button interface,
            so I could adjust the home position, do dry runs, turn on the visible
            red laser, etc.
          </p>

          <div class="imgWireFrame">
            <p>
              Yup, should have snagged a photo of the Laser printer control
              panel. It would have looked great here. :/
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            I was able to get a reasonable print on the first try, although
            it came out with more contrast than I expected, and required a
            second pass to cut it out. The second pass surprised me, as I
            inlucded a vector rectangle outlining my image. Something about
            those printer settings, I guess. A bit of cleaning and sanding
            lightened up the sky, helping my name to "pop" more.
          </p>
          <div class="imgWireFrame">
            <p>
              This is where I would have includes pics or gifs of the
              lasercutting process ... if I had taken any. :/
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2> TA-DAH!! Finished Product!</h2>
          <p>
            A lot darker than the original image, but at least it worked. Pretty
            happy with the way the font turned out. I had printed the other fonts
            onto wood, too; but outside the image boundary.
          </p>

          <h2> What I  Liked</h2>
          <p> Got a passable print on the first try.</p>

          <h2> What I'd do better at next time.</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Print a bunch of 1x2 inch "mini nameplates" with different
              laser settings, for different contrast and sharpness effects.
            </li>
            <li>Spend more time fiddling with settings in general.</li>
            <li>TAKE. MORE. PHOTOS.</li>
          </ul>
