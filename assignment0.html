    <h2>Coming up with an Idea</h2>
    <p>
      I spent last Saturday (April 6, 2019) at the
      <a href= "https://hfs.uw.edu/Maker-Summit-2019"> UW Maker summit</a>.
      There was lasercutting workshop at
      <a href="https://reg.hfs.uw.edu/Program/GetProducts?productTypeCV=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000003502&classification=3e2e1a82-4f98-473b-b791-30ab7fe14c4c">
        the MILL</a>,
        so I used that as an opportunity to do my homework.
      </p>

      <h2>Finding a Cool Image</h2>
      <p>
        One of my pastimes is browsing aircraft photos on
        <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdWings/">r/WierdWings<a> on
          <a href="www.reddit.com">reddit.</a>  If found an image of a
          <a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdWings/comments/b9sd6q/dornier_do_x_in_florida_on_trip_from_germany_to/">
            Dorinier DoX from 1931.</a>
            It's a seaplane that literally looks like a "flying boat."  The image itself is a sepia toned,
            perhaps a daguerreotype, so I thought it would look good burned in wood. The top half
            of the image is mostly empty sky, so if I filled the space with my name in all caps,
            I'd have a good Nameboard.

          <h2> Pickng a font </h2>
          <p>
            It took awhile to find a font that worked well with the image.
            I wanted something with blocky, with some "Olde English flair", but
            still legible. It also had to be mostly solid -- providing good contrast
            and readability at a distance.
