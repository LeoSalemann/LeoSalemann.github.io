      Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!

    <h2>Building the test Jig</h2>

    <h3>Planning an Approach</h3>
    <p>
      First thing I gotta do is make a "jig" with different slot thickneses.
      My calipers give me a thickness of 0.1580 in. Adobe Illustrator seems to
      stop at 0.01 inch increments. Okay, we'll make slots at 0.16, 0.17, 0.18
      0.2.
    </p>

    <h3>Drawing the Jig </h3>
    <p>
      I was hoping I could draw a rectangle, add some points, and cut things out.
      Adobe Illustrator doesn't seem to let me do that (not without a fight,
      anyway), so I'll go line by line instead.  Not has hard as I thought, once
      you start copy/pasting the repetitive lines.

    <p>
      Heh. Here's an idea. Imma put a notch at the top of my jig, so I know
      which end is which -- 0.016 will start at the notch
    </p>

      Now I gotta figure out how to make the camphers. Gonna need to shop
      off my "end lines" ....
    </P>

    <p>
      Add some angled campheres (thank you copy/paste/flip-vertical)...
    </p>

    <p>
      And reconnect the ends!
    </p>

    <p>Okay, one more copy/paste so I have a pair, and it's off to the
      lasercutter!</p>

      <p>
        Well, crap.  Even my tightest slot is too loose.  Need to figure out how
        to see sub-tenth line lenghts.  Aha! clicking <em>Shape</em> gets you a
        form with exactl lenth and angle.  Going to change up my slots to be
        0.146 0.148 0.150 0.152 0.154.
