    <h2>Building the Test Gauge</h2>

    <h3>Planning an Approach</h3>
    <p>
      First thing I gotta do is make a "gauge" with different slot thicknesses.
      My calipers give me a thickness of 0.1580 in. Adobe Illustrator seems to
      stop at 0.01 inch increments. Okay, we'll make slots at 0.16, 0.17, 0.18
      0.2.
    </p>

    <h3>Drawing the Gauge </h3>
    <p>
      I was hoping I could draw a rectangle, add some points, and cut things out.
      Adobe Illustrator doesn't seem to let me do that (not without a fight,
      anyway), so I'll go line by line instead.  Not has hard as I thought, once
      you start copy/pasting the repetitive lines.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Heh. Here's an idea. Imma put a notch at the top of my guage, so I know
      which end is which -- 0.016 will start at the notch
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Now I gotta figure out how to make the camphers. Gonna need to chop
      off my "end lines" ....
    </P>

      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic03-gauge.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>This is getting tedious.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Add some angled campheres (thank you copy/paste/flip-vertical)...
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic04-gauge.png" width=400><
      <figcaption>Okay maybe not as bad as I thought.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      And reconnect the ends!
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic05-gauge.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Okay maybe not as bad as I thought.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Okay, one more copy/paste so I have a pair, and it's off to the
    lasercutter!</p>

    <p>
      Well, crap.  Even my tightest slot is too loose.  Need to figure out how
      to see sub-tenth line lenghts.  Aha! clicking <em>Shape</em> gets you a
      form with exactl lenth and angle.  Going to change up my slots to be
      0.146 0.148 0.150 0.152 0.154.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic06-print1.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Might look okay, but it's actually really loose.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Aha!  Adobe Illustrator provides a <em>Shape</em> toolbar item that gives you full control over line length!
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Success! ...just barely. The tighest slots (0.146 in) fit great. Tempted
      to make that my new midpoint and try for even tighter, but it's getting
      late and I need my beauty sleep.

    <h2>Building the Actual Kit</h2>

    <p>
      Okay, it's been a couple days since the gauge build. Imma build a frame for a wing.  Grab a legit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil" >NACA Airfoil</a>, cut some notches in it, replicate, and include some more parts for the wing outline & a spart or two. I need 12 parts, so ... a wing outline, a spar, ten airofils. Maybe a few more spars and less foils.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I've had another epiphany!</em> I shouldn't need to do a bunch of line-by-line
      tedium like I did for the guage.  A simple overlapping rectangle should do just fine! Add a triangle, and I can get a campher!. Don't know what I'm talking about? Here's a sketch:
    </p>

      <figcaption>Super-mega epiphany #3: OVERLAPPING SHAPES.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay so let's try this. I'm gonna find a symmetrical airfiol, and make a
      little "3D teardrop" like this:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic10-sketch02.png"  width=400>
      <figcaption>I think this will work ... </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      First-off, let's find an arfoil on
      <a href ="http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit"> arfoiltools.com</a>,
      download as SVG, then import into  Adobe Illutrator.
      This one looks promising.
    </p>

      <figcaption>NACA Airfoil 0018. Thick & symmetrical.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The SVG loaded into Adobe Illustrator okay, but it inlcuded all the gridlines
      and titles and junk with it.  After learning a bit more mouseology, I could
      isolate the airfoil. Add soome rectangles for slots, triangle for camphers,
      and we're ready to print.
    </p>

      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic12-airfoil-NACA-0018-in-adobe-ai.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Hope this works.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Not bad.  Used a lower power setting so some of the cuts didn't go all the way through. Had to do a bit of touch-up with an Exacto, but they came out.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Printed parts</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Pretty happy with how things assembled. Nice flush fit with between the circle and the two airofils. Need to make the parts larger next time, and aovid long thing tapers.  Also keep up with those triangle camphers.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <h2>Scaling Up</h2>
    <p>
      Right, then; our little "drop tank" test proves this will work, let's make a wing!  Back to the sketch book.  We'll want a "rectangular hoop" for the basic wing frame. Then a bunch of airfoil ribs, and three spars.   So to meet requirements, we need at least eight ribs for a total of 12 parts.
    </p>
