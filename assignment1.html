    <h2>Building the Test Gauge</h2>

    <h3>Planning an Approach</h3>
    <p>
      First thing I gotta do is make a "gauge" with different slot thicknesses.
      My calipers give me a thickness of 0.1580 in. Adobe Illustrator seems to
      stop at 0.01 inch increments. Okay, we'll make slots at 0.16, 0.17, 0.18
      0.2.
    </p>

    <h3>Drawing the Gauge </h3>
    <p>
      I was hoping I could draw a rectangle, add some points, and cut things out.
      Adobe Illustrator doesn't seem to let me do that (not without a fight,
      anyway), so I'll go line by line instead.  Not has hard as I thought, once
      you start copy/pasting the repetitive lines.
    </p>

      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic01-gauge.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>First few lines in Adobe Illustrator</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Heh. Here's an idea. Imma put a notch at the top of my guage, so I know
      which end is which -- 0.016 will start at the notch
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic02-gauge.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Super-mega epiphany #1: THE NOTCH.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Now I gotta figure out how to make the camphers. Gonna need to chop
      off my "end lines" ....
    </P>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic03-gauge.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>This is getting tedious.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Add some angled campheres (thank you copy/paste/flip-vertical)...
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic04-gauge.png" width=400><
      <figcaption>Okay maybe not as bad as I thought.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      And reconnect the ends!
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic05-gauge.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Okay maybe not as bad as I thought.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Okay, one more copy/paste so I have a pair, and it's off to the
    lasercutter!</p>

    <p>
      Well, crap.  Even my tightest slot is too loose.  Need to figure out how
      to see sub-tenth line lenghts.  Aha! clicking <em>Shape</em> gets you a
      form with exactl lenth and angle.  Going to change up my slots to be
      0.146 0.148 0.150 0.152 0.154.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic06-print1.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Might look okay, but it's actually really loose.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Aha!  Adobe Illustrator provides a <em>Shape</em> toolbar item that gives you full control over line length!
    </p>

      <figcaption>Super-mega epiphany #2: THE SHAPE TOOL.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Success! ...just barely. The tighest slots (0.146 in) fit great. Tempted
      to make that my new midpoint and try for even tighter, but it's getting
      late and I need my beauty sleep.
    </p>

    </figure>


    <h2>Building the Actual Kit</h2>

    <p>
      Okay, it's been a couple days since the gauge build. Imma build a frame for a wing.  Grab a legit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil" >NACA Airfoil</a>, cut some notches in it, replicate, and include some more parts for the wing outline & a spart or two. I need 12 parts, so ... a wing outline, a spar, ten airofils. Maybe a few more spars and less foils.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I've had another epiphany!</em> I shouldn't need to do a bunch of line-by-line
      tedium like I did for the guage.  A simple overlapping rectangle should do just fine! Add a triangle, and I can get a campher!. Don't know what I'm talking about? Here's a sketch:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic09-sketch01.png"  width=400>
      <figcaption>Super-mega epiphany #3: OVERLAPPING SHAPES.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay so let's try this. I'm gonna find a symmetrical airfiol, and make a
      little "3D teardrop" like this:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic10-sketch02.png"  width=400>
      <figcaption>I think this will work ... </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      First-off, let's find an arfoil on
      <a href ="http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit"> arfoiltools.com</a>,
      download as SVG, then import into  Adobe Illutrator.
      This one looks promising.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic11-airfoil-NACA-0018.png"  width=400>
      <figcaption>NACA Airfoil 0018. Thick & symmetrical.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The SVG loaded into Adobe Illustrator okay, but it inlcuded all the gridlines
      and titles and junk with it.  After learning a bit more mouseology, I could
      isolate the airfoil. Add soome rectangles for slots, triangle for camphers,
      and we're ready to print.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic12-airfoil-NACA-0018-in-adobe-ai.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Hope this works.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Not bad.  Used a lower power setting so some of the cuts didn't go all the way through. Had to do a bit of touch-up with an Exacto, but they came out.
    </p>

    <figure>

      <figcaption>Printed parts</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Pretty happy with how things assembled. Nice flush fit with between the circle and the two airofils. Need to make the parts larger next time, and aovid long thing tapers.  Also keep up with those triangle camphers.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Assembled parts</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Scaling Up</h2>
    <p>
      Right, then; our little "drop tank" test proves this will work, let's make a wing!  Back to the sketch book.  We'll want a "rectangular hoop" for the basic wing frame. Then a bunch of airfoil ribs, and three spars.   So to meet requirements, we need at least eight ribs for a total of 12 parts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, that was a headache. LOTS of little elements to line up. Had to draw a bunch of guidelines. Which I ALMOST FORGOT to delete before printing.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic16-3rib-prototype.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Yeah, it would have been bad to try printing this.</figcaption>
    </figure>

      <figcaption>This one's printable (I think).</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>
      Headache #2. I had my airfoil set up as a library element, so I lost it when I copied my ai doc over to thumbrdive to print from one of the UW MILL machines.  Now let's try printing ....
    </p>

    <h3>Uh-Oh</h3>
    <p>
      I've learned a valuable lesson about print order. Pretty terifying to watch some parts "scallop up" before the print's done. Everything came out okay, though.
    </p>

      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic18-3rib-scalloping.jpg" width=400>
      <figcaption>Please don't screw up. Please don't screw up.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic19-3rib-parts-layout.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Whew! Got some parts without burnind down the MILL.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Headache #3. I discovered I forgot some of the rectangular cutouts. Had to improvise with a utility
      knife, but built myself a mini wing.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic20-3rib-assembled.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Okay, I can make a wing; now I need one with more parts.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2> Day Three. I should really finish this</h2>
    <p>Added camphers</p>
    <p>Looks like I can separate by art boards. Try that.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic21-print-by-artboard-or-layers.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Either artboards or layering ... one of them's gotta work (I hope).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p> Need a layering system like this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tiny triangles</li>
      <li>Small rectangles</li>
      <li>wing profiles</li>
      <li>big parts</li>
      <li>guide lines</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I don't think artboards are going to work, I'll try layers instead</p>
    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic22-ai-layers.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Now I think I'm onto something.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Printing by layers was highly successful for the second "mini wing." Confident and ready to move on to main wing.  Also, two mini wings are 14 parts total, so I kinda met the requirements already.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic23-successful-layered-print.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Yay! Three passes and now scalloping!</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay, time to set up the layers for the main Big Wing.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Layer 2: Tiny Parts (rectangular cutouts and camphers). These will be printed first.</figcaption>

    </figure>

    <p>  
      Putting all the layers together, you can see how the guidelines help to keep all 
      recuagular cutouts lined up. You can also see how it would utterly destroy the 
      ouptut if we actually printed them.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Altogether now!</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Okay, Let's Start Printing(Finally)!</h3>
    <p>
      Printing by layers was pretty easy.  Just selectively turn one layer on and all the others off, and make sure "Print Visible Layers" is enabled.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Print the large parts last.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Crap. A lot of the small parts didn't cut all the way through. Forgot to set my power at 100.  Time for the exacto knife again.
    </p>

    <p>On the plus side, the build went pretty easy</p>

    </figure>

    <h2>Finished Product!</h2>
    
    <p>
      Not bad. Pretty happy with the way the wing spars meshed into the airfoils. Too bad the front edge of the frame juts beyond the arfoils. Looks like I didn't have
      the airofil & cutouts properly aligned.  Good enough, though for a proof of concept.
