		<h2>TL;DR:</h2>

		<p>Started by building a test gauge line-by-line. That was painful.</p>

			<img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic03-gauge.png" width=400>
			<figcaption>There's gotta be an easier way.</figcaption>

		<p>Figured out I could overlap separate shapes for cutouts. That was easier.</p>

		<p>Figured out how to export actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil" >NACA Airfoils</a>
			as SVG from <a href ="http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit"> arfoiltools.com</a>, then import into Adobe Illustrator.

			<h2>The DEETS (sooooo many deets)</h2>
			<h2>Building the Test Gauge</h2>

			<h3>Planning an Approach</h3>
			<p>
				First thing I gotta do is make a "gauge" with different slot thicknesses.
				My calipers give me a thickness of 0.1580 in. Adobe Illustrator seems to
				stop at 0.01 inch increments. Okay, we'll make slots at 0.16, 0.17, 0.18
				0.2.
			</p>

			<h3>Drawing the Gauge </h3>
			<p>
				I was hoping I could draw a rectangle, add some points, and cut things out.
				Adobe Illustrator doesn't seem to let me do that (not without a fight,
				anyway), so I'll go line by line instead.  Not has hard as I thought, once
				you start copy/pasting the repetitive lines.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic01-gauge.png" width=400>
				<figcaption>First few lines in Adobe Illustrator</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Heh. Here's an idea. Imma put a notch at the top of my gauge, so I know
				which end is which -- 0.016 will start at the notch.
			</p>

				<figcaption>Super-mega epiphany #1: THE NOTCH.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Now I gotta figure out how to make the chamfers. Gonna need to chop
				off my "end lines" ....
			</P>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic03-gauge.png" width=400>
				<figcaption>This is getting tedious.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Add some angled chamfers (thank you copy/paste/flip-vertical)...
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic04-gauge.png" width=400><
				<figcaption>Okay maybe not as bad as I thought.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				And reconnect the ends!
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic05-gauge.png" width=400>
				<figcaption>There, that wasn't so bad.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Okay, one more copy/paste so I have a pair, and it's off to the
				lasercutter!</p>

				<p>
					Well, crap.  Even my tightest slot is too loose.  Need to figure out how
					to see sub-tenth line lengths.  Aha! clicking <em>Shape</em> gets you a
					form that lets you set exact length and angle.  Going to change up my slots to be
					0.146 0.148 0.150 0.152 0.154.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="img/hcde598-hw01-pic06-print1.png" width=400>
					<figcaption>Might look okay, but it's actually really loose.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					Aha!  Adobe Illustrator provides a <em>Shape</em> toolbar item that gives
					you full control over line length!
				</p>

					<figcaption>Super-mega epiphany #2: THE SHAPE TOOL.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					Success! ...just barely. The tighest slots (0.146 in) fit great. Tempted
					to make that my new midpoint and try for even tighter, but it's getting
					late and I need my beauty sleep.
				</p>

				<!-- DAY TWO: MINIT KIT BUILD -->
				<h2>Day Two: Building the Actual Kit</h2>

				<p>
					Okay, it's been a couple days since the gauge build. Imma build a frame
					for a wing.  Grab a legit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil">
						NACA Airfoil</a>, cut some notches in it, replicate, and include some more
						parts for the wing outline and a spar or two. I need 12 parts, so ... a
						wing outline, a spar, ten airfoils. Maybe a few more spars and less foils.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>I've had another epiphany!</em> I shouldn't need to do a bunch of
						line-by-line tedium like I did for the gauge.  A simple overlapping rectangle
						should do just fine! Add a triangle, and I can get a chamfer! Don't know
						what I'm talking about? Here's a sketch:
					</p>

					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic09-sketch01.png"  width=400>
						<figcaption>Super-mega epiphany #3: OVERLAPPING SHAPES.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>
						Okay so let's try this. I'm gonna find a symmetrical airfoil, and make a
						little "3D teardrop" like this:
					</p>

					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic10-sketch02.png"  width=400>
						<figcaption>I think this will work ... </figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>
						First-off, let's find an arfoil on
						<a href ="http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit"> arfoiltools.com</a>,
						download as SVG, then import into  Adobe Illutrator.
						This one looks promising.
					</p>

						<figcaption>NACA Airfoil 0018. Thick & symmetrical.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>
						The SVG loaded into Adobe Illustrator okay, but it inlcuded all the gridlines
						and titles and junk with it.  After learning a bit more mouseology, I could
						isolate the airfoil. Add some rectangles for slots, triangles for chamfers,
						and we're ready to print.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic12-airfoil-NACA-0018-in-adobe-ai.png" width=400>
						<figcaption>Hope this works.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>
						Not bad.  Used a lower power setting so some of the cuts didn't go all the
						way through. Had to do a bit of touch-up with an x-acto, but they came out.
					</p>

					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic13-airfoil-NACA-0018-printed.png" width=400>
						<figcaption>Printed parts</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>
						Pretty happy with how things assembled. Nice flush fit between the circle
						and the two airofils. Need to make the parts larger next time, and avoid
						ong thin tapers.  Also keep up with those triangle chamfers.
					</p>

						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic14-airfoil-NACA-0018-assembled.png" width=400>
						<figcaption>Assembled parts</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h2>Scaling Up</h2>
					<p>
						Right, then. Our little "drop tank" test proves this will work; let's make
						a wing!  Back to the sketch book.  We'll want a "rectangular hoop" for the
						basic wing frame. Then a bunch of airfoil ribs, and three spars.   So to
						meet requirements, we need at least eight ribs for a total of 12 parts.
					</p>

					<p>
						Well, that was a headache. LOTS of little elements to line up. Had to draw
						a bunch of guidelines. Which I ALMOST FORGOT to delete before printing.
					</p>

					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic16-3rib-prototype.png" width=400>
						<figcaption>Yeah, it would have been bad to try printing this.</figcaption>

						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic17-3rib-prototype-cleaned.png" width=400>
						<figcaption>This one's printable (I think).</figcaption>
					</figure>


					<p>
						Headache #2. I had my airfoil set up as a library element, so I lost it
						when I copied my ai doc over to thumb drive to print from one of the UW
						MILL machines.  Now let's try printing ....
					</p>

					<h3>Uh-Oh</h3>
					<p>
						I've learned a valuable lesson about print order. Pretty terrifying to
						watch some parts "scallop up" before the print's done. Everything came
						out okay, though.
					</p>

						<figcaption>Whew! Got some parts without burning down the MILL.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>
						Headache #3. I discovered I forgot some of the rectangular cutouts. Had to
						improvise with a utility
						knife, but built myself a mini wing.
					</p>

					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic20-3rib-assembled.png" width=400>
						<figcaption>Okay, I can make a wing; now I need one with more parts.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<!-- DAY THREE: FINISH IT ALREADY -->
					<h2> Day Three. I Should Really Finish This</h2>
					<p>Last night, I drew out my big giant wing, but didn't have time to print it.
						This morning, I added chamfers. Before I print anything, I need to find a
						way to control which parts get printed in what order.
					</p>

					<p> Need a layering system like this:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Tiny triangles</li>
						<li>Small rectangles</li>
						<li>wing profiles</li>
						<li>big parts</li>
						<li>guide lines</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Looks like I can separate by art boards. Try that.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic21-print-by-artboard-or-layers.png" width=600>
						<figcaption>Either artboards or layering ... one of them's gotta work (I hope).</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>I don't think artboards are going to work, they just make separate pages
						next to each other. I'll try layers instead
					</p>

					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic22-ai-layers.png" width=800>
						<figcaption>Now I think I'm onto something.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Printing by layers was highly successful for the second "mini wing."
						Confident and ready to move on to main wing.  Also, two mini wings are 14
						parts total, so I kinda met the requirements already.
					</p>

						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic23-successful-layered-print.png" width=400>
						<figcaption>Super-mega epiphany #4: LAYERS.</figcaption>

					<p>
						Okay, time to set up the layers for the main Big Wing.
					</p>

						<figcaption>Layer 4: Huge Parts (wing frame and spars). These are last to	print.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>
						Putting all the layers together, you can see how the guidelines help to keep all
						recuagular cutouts lined up. You can also see how it would utterly destroy the
						ouptut if we actually printed them.
					</p>

					<figure>
						<img src ="img/hcde598-hw01-pic28-all-layers.png" width=800>
						<figcaption>Altogether now!</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h3>Okay, Let's (Finally) Start Printing!</h3>
					<p>
						Printing by layers was pretty easy.  Just selectively turn one
						layer on and all the others off, and make sure print mode is set
						to "Visible and Printable Layers" <em>not</em> "All Layers."
					</p>

						<figcaption>Print the large parts last.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>
						Crap. A lot of the small parts didn't cut all the way through. Forgot
						 to set my power at 100.  Time for the x-acto knife again.
					</p>

						<figcaption>Using the wing spar to align the airfoils.</figcaption>

					<h2>Finished Product!</h2>

					<p>
						Not bad. Pretty happy with the way the wing spars meshed into the
						airfoils; too bad the front edge of the frame juts beyond them.
						Looks like I didn't have the airfoil & cutouts properly aligned.  Good
						enough, though for a proof of concept.
