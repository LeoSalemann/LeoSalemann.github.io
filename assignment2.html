    <!-- DEETS -->
    <h2>Waaayyyyy Too Many DEETS</h2>
    <!-- DAY ONE -->
    <h2>Day One: Fixin' To Get Ready</h2>
    <p>
      Right, then.  We're supposed to re-create homework 1 parametrically,
      in <a href ="https://www.rhino3d.com/download">Rhino</a> with
      <a href ="https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/grasshopper">Grasshopper</a>.
      The basic idea is to parametrically handle arbitrary thicknesses, and
      to use two thicknesses in the actual build. I think Imma have to:
      <ol>
        <li>Draw some sketches.</li>
        <li>Watch some Grasshopper tutorials.</li>
        <li>CAD some stuff.</li>
        <li>Print some stuff.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Sketching</h2>
    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic01-sketch1.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Parts, Thicknesses, and Parameters</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay, so if I go with the original design, I have three parametric
      thicknesses at least:
      <ol>
        <li>Airfoil Thickness (T1)</li>
        <li>"Main Hoop" Thickness (T2)</li>
        <li>Spar Thickness (T3)</li>
      </ol>

      In reality, T1 will probably be pretty small, T3 will be bigger,
      and T2 will be huge. If I wanna go crazy, Each spar could be a
      unique thickness, so there'd be T1, T2, T3a, T3b, T3c.  It'd
      be a pain to gather so many material thicknesses, so I probalby
      won't actually go that far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing I could do is ditch the hoop entirely, and just go
      with notched beams at the leading and (maybe) trailind edges. It'd
      be interesting to see what it's like to assemble that way, and home
      strong the finished product is, so I'll probalby do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      So anyway, based on what little I know of Rhino Grasshopper, my
      visual programming diagram thingy would look somehting like this
      (below). To make things easier (and lighter!)  I've removed the
      "hoop frame" so I'm only dealing with spars and airfoils.
      Consequently, I no longer have to worry about T2 from the prior
      sketch, and can concentrate on T1 and T3.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic02-sketch2.png" width=400>
      <figcaption>Sketching for Grasshopper.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      I've also added d1 and d3 so the cutout rectangles can have
      lengths to go width their widths. Rectangle A (for the spar)
      is d1 x T1; Rectangle B (for the airfoil a.k.a. rib) is d3 x T3.
      Spar height and airfoil height (I'll reserve "thickness" to
      describe material thickness" will both be d1+d3. When I work up
      spars for the other slot locations on the airfoil, the airfoil
      slots will always be d3 x T3, but the d1 used on the spars
      will vary.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quick rework of my 3-rib prototype suggests it'll still be
      plenty strong.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Look Ma, no hoop! Just ribs and beams.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The tricky part in all this will be getting grasshopper to "read"
      my custom airfoil shape, cut notches in it, and replicate it. So
      having done this sketching, thinking, writing exercise, I know that
      I need tutorials covering:
      <ul>
        <li>Recangular Arrays</li>
        <li>Trimming</li>
        <li>Importing or referencing cusotom geometry</li>
      </ul>

      Spoiler alert: I already figured out how to import my SVG airfoil
      into Rhino!

    <!-- DAY TWO -->
    <h2>Day Two, What to Do?</h2>
    <p>
      Okay last night was about thinking and sketching; tonight is tutorial time!
      But first .... we've got an actual assignment description now.  I need:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>3 shapes, two thicknesses</strong> My simple 3-rib mini wing would be meet the minimum bar.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide a link to source files.</strong> Been there, done that.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>I can use plugins if I attribute them.</strong> OMG OMG OMG I found a
          <a href="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/profiles/blogs/naca-series-4-aerofoil-generator">
            Grashopper plugin to generate NACA Airfoils!
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Tutorials</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://www.modelab.is/grasshopper-primer/">
      ModelLab Grasshopper Primer</a></h3>

      <p>
        Pretty slow and wordy; got a few nuggets out of it though.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <strong>Divide Component</strong>could be handy for dividing
            my spar into equal sections for the airfoils(ribs).
          </li>
          <li>I can use <strong>Panels</strong> for comments.</li>
        </ul>

        All in all, thought I  found the ModelLab primer slow and wordy. The
        little mini tutorials that come up when you first start Grasshoper
        look good and succinct, though.
      </p>

      <!-- DAY THREE -->
      <h2> Day Three, Oh My Oh Me</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't get through nearly enough tutorials the other night, but at
        least I have some leads. Gonna do those ones from the Grashopper
        start page, as well as the
        <a href ="https://blog.ramboll.com/rcd/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-visual-scripting-with-grasshopper.html">
          Ramboll Blog Grashopper Tutorial
        </a>
        suggested by Kimberly Dzuibinski.
      </p>
      <h2>More Tutorials</h2>
      <h3>Grashopper Embedded Tutorials</h3>
      <p>Let's start with the tutirials Grashopper shows at startup time.
        Same ones you can get to from Help > Tutorial Files.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>01 Simple Input and Maths</strong>
        This is more like it.  Really digging the open-ended exploratory feel
        of these. Got a good grip on how to use panels for comments, and the
        sprectrum of input types avaialble to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>02 Interpolating Values</strong>
        This on3 helped me wrap my head around how to connect geometry from Rhino
        (Pt) to Grasshopper. Playing with colors was way too fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>03 Wires & Conversions</strong>

        Moving right along. The "Hold down shift" trick will come in handy when
        connecting multiple wires, the XYZ to Point conversin might come in
        handy too.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>04 Polynomial Grpahing with Derivatives</strong>
        Okay, this one's funky. Probably won't go this hardcore unless I
        start defining NACA airfoils from their base equations.  Might come
        back to this one to help read & understand

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>05 Measure and Display Values</strong>
        I like the title of this one. A little hard to grock, but I <em>think</em>
        I'll be able to use some of this when I want to measure positions off my
        airofoils, like d3 and d1 below.

        <figure>
          <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic05-airfoil-measurments.png" width=400>
          <figcaption>Imma need to measure d1 and d3 eventually.</figcaption>
        </figure>

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>06 Adaptive Pattern within Shape</strong>
        Thought this would be out of my league at first glance, but I can kinda
        see how <em>Join, InCurve,</em> and <em>Cull</em> could be used to
        create my rectangular "slots" and clip them into my airfoils.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>07 Column Arcade</strong>
        Oooh ... repeating patterns! Hmm... I dunno.  There's a lot of fuky stuff
        going on in this one, and the simple "replicate this shape in XY for N
        times" isn't jumping out at me.  probalby need to look elsewhere for that.
      </p>

        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Right, then.  Feeling a bit less noobish, but still wanna look at the
        <a href ="https://blog.ramboll.com/rcd/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-visual-scripting-with-grasshopper.html">
          Ramboll Blog Grashopper Tutorial
        </a>
        that Kimberly Dziubinski found.  Skimmed the first page or tow, but found
        some good nuggets starting right before section 3.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>View > Obscure Components</strong> So I can actually
            see what-all elements are avaialable.
          </li>
          <strong>Display > Draw Icons</strong> I probably wasn't ready
          for this sooner, but I feel ready now.
          <strong></strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      Okay, the big reaveal for me is how to use tabs other than <em>Params</em>
      and <em>Components</em>. The Ramboll Blog Tutorial got me into the
      <em>Curve</em> tab.  I'm normally very GUI-oriented, but getting more and
      more drawn to the "double-click and type" textual method.
    </p>

    <h2>Right Then, Let's Build Something!</h2>
    <p>
      I'll start with a gauge. It'll be nice have a middle slot that matches my
      caliper reading, and the rest auto-calculate like this:
      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic06-gauge-sketch.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>My first rectangle</figcaption>
      </figure>

      Okay, let's go into Grashopper for real this time.  A couple number sliders
      a <em>Rectangle</em> component and ..
      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic07-gauge-in-grasshopper.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>My first rectangle</figcaption>
      </figure>

      Now let's see if I can re-create ... THE NOTCH. Last time it was about
      0.3 inches. Use hard-coded number param, grab the rectangle dimentions,
      a bit of math, and ... I don't know why that was so hard. The bloody
      <em>Move</em> wouldn't work -- kept saying "this component is currently
      inactive." Finally I just went back to my in-class document, rejiggered
      it, and did a save as/overwrite of my original guage doc.  Whatever, it's
      working now.

        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic08-gauge-add-notch.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Adding THE NOTCH</figcaption>
      </figure>

      Okay, on to the main event, let's make the actual "gauge slots ..." well
      that was more complicated than I thought. Good thing I found the
      <em>Group</em> function or I'd be going nuts about now.

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic09-gauge-add-caliper-slot.png" width=400>
