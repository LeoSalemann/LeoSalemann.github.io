          Boy did I go full masochist on this thing. Kinda glad I did it, but
          jeez I spent a lot time grouping, re-arranging, and rewiring things.
        </li>
        <li>
          Making a paremetric guage to test my cardboard thicknesses at up almost
          all my time ... but boy did I learn Grashopper.
        </li>

        <li>
          Skteching first helped.

          After paramterizing the living crap out of my gauge and wing spar,  I
          had to go low-brow and set my airfoil (parameterically generated) notches
          by hand in Rhnio.

      <h2>Day One: Fixin' To Get Ready</h2>
      <p>
        Right, then.  We're supposed to re-create homework 1 parametrically,
        in <a href ="https://www.rhino3d.com/download">Rhino</a> with
        <a href ="https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/grasshopper">Grasshopper</a>.
        The basic idea is to parametrically handle arbitrary thicknesses, and
        to use two thicknesses in the actual build. I think Imma have to:
        <ol>
          <li>Draw some sketches.</li>
          <li>Watch some Grasshopper tutorials.</li>
          <li>CAD some stuff.</li>
          <li>Print some stuff.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>Sketching</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic01-sketch1.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Parts, Thicknesses, and Parameters</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, so if I go with the original design, I have three parametric
        thicknesses at least:
        <ol>
          <li>Airfoil Thickness (T1)</li>
          <li>"Main Hoop" Thickness (T2)</li>
          <li>Spar Thickness (T3)</li>
        </ol>

        In reality, T1 will probably be pretty small, T3 will be bigger,
        and T2 will be huge. If I wanna go crazy, Each spar could be a
        unique thickness, so there'd be T1, T2, T3a, T3b, T3c.  It'd
        be a pain to gather so many material thicknesses, so I probalby
        won't actually go that far.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I could do is ditch the hoop entirely, and just go
        with notched beams at the leading and (maybe) trailind edges. It'd
        be interesting to see what it's like to assemble that way, and home
        strong the finished product is, so I'll probalby do that.
      </p>

      <p>
        So anyway, based on what little I know of Rhino Grasshopper, my
        visual programming diagram thingy would look somehting like this
        (below). To make things easier (and lighter!)  I've removed the
        "hoop frame" so I'm only dealing with spars and airfoils.
        Consequently, I no longer have to worry about T2 from the prior
        sketch, and can concentrate on T1 and T3.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic02-sketch2.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Sketching for Grasshopper.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I've also added d1 and d3 so the cutout rectangles can have
        lengths to go width their widths. Rectangle A (for the spar)
        is d1 x T1; Rectangle B (for the airfoil a.k.a. rib) is d3 x T3.
        Spar height and airfoil height (I'll reserve "thickness" to
        describe material thickness" will both be d1+d3. When I work up
        spars for the other slot locations on the airfoil, the airfoil
        slots will always be d3 x T3, but the d1 used on the spars
        will vary.
      </p>

      <p>
        A quick rework of my 3-rib prototype suggests it'll still be
        plenty strong.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic03-3rib-no-hoop.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Look Ma, no hoop! Just ribs and beams.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The tricky part in all this will be getting grasshopper to "read"
        my custom airfoil shape, cut notches in it, and replicate it. So
        having done this sketching, thinking, writing exercise, I know that
        I need tutorials covering:
        <ul>
          <li>Recangular Arrays</li>
          <li>Trimming</li>
          <li>Importing or referencing cusotom geometry</li>
        </ul>

        Spoiler alert: I already figured out how to import my SVG airfoil
        into Rhino!

      <p>
        Okay last night was about thinking and sketching; tonight is tutorial time!
        But first .... we've got an actual assignment description now.  I need:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3 shapes, two thicknesses</strong> My simple 3-rib mini wing would be meet the minimum bar.</li>
          <li><strong>Provide a link to source files.</strong> Been there, done that.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>I can use plugins if I attribute them.</strong> OMG OMG OMG I found a

        <a href="https://www.modelab.is/grasshopper-primer/">
          ModelLab Grasshopper Primer
        </a>

      <p>
        Pretty slow and wordy; got a few nuggets out of it though.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>Divide Component</strong>could be handy for dividing
          my spar into equal sections for the airfoils(ribs).
        </li>
        <li>I can use <strong>Panels</strong> for comments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All in all, thought I  found the ModelLab primer slow and wordy. The
        little mini tutorials that come up when you first start Grasshoper
        look good and succinct, though.

      <p>
        I didn't get through nearly enough tutorials the other night, but at
        least I have some leads. Gonna do those ones from the Grashopper
        start page, as well as the
        <a href ="https://blog.ramboll.com/rcd/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-visual-scripting-with-grasshopper.html">
          Ramboll Blog Grashopper Tutorial
        </a>
        suggested by Kimberly Dzuibinski.
      </p>
      <h3>Grashopper Embedded Tutorials</h3>
      <p>Let's start with the tutirials Grashopper shows at startup time.
        Same ones you can get to from Help > Tutorial Files.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>01 Simple Input and Maths</strong>
        This is more like it.  Really digging the open-ended exploratory feel
        of these. Got a good grip on how to use panels for comments, and the
        sprectrum of input types avaialble to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>02 Interpolating Values</strong>
        This on3 helped me wrap my head around how to connect geometry from Rhino
        (Pt) to Grasshopper. Playing with colors was way too fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>03 Wires & Conversions</strong>

        Moving right along. The "Hold down shift" trick will come in handy when
        connecting multiple wires, the XYZ to Point conversin might come in
        handy too.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>04 Polynomial Grpahing with Derivatives</strong>
        Okay, this one's funky. Probably won't go this hardcore unless I
        start defining NACA airfoils from their base equations.  Might come
        back to this one to help read & understand
        <a href ="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/GarethPaterson">
          Dr. Gareth Paterson's

          NACA Series 4 Airfoil generators
        </a>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>05 Measure and Display Values</strong>
        I like the title of this one. A little hard to grock, but I <em>think</em>
        I'll be able to use some of this when I want to measure positions off my
        airofoils, like d3 and d1 below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic05-airfoil-measurments.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Imma need to measure d1 and d3 eventually.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>06 Adaptive Pattern within Shape</strong>
        Thought this would be out of my league at first glance, but I can kinda
        see how <em>Join, InCurve,</em> and <em>Cull</em> could be used to
        create my rectangular "slots" and clip them into my airfoils.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>07 Column Arcade</strong>
        Oooh ... repeating patterns! Hmm... I dunno.  There's a lot of fuky stuff
        going on in this one, and the simple "replicate this shape in XY for N
        times" isn't jumping out at me.  probalby need to look elsewhere for that.
      </p>

        </a>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Right, then.  Feeling a bit less noobish, but still wanna look at the
        <a href ="https://blog.ramboll.com/rcd/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-visual-scripting-with-grasshopper.html">
          Ramboll Blog Grashopper Tutorial
        </a>
        that Kimberly Dziubinski found.  Skimmed the first page or tow, but found
        some good nuggets starting right before section 3.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>View > Obscure Components</strong> So I can actually
            see what-all elements are avaialable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Display > Draw Icons</strong> I probably wasn't ready
            for this sooner, but I feel ready now.
            <strong></strong>
          </li>
        </ul>

        Okay, the big reaveal for me is how to use tabs other than <em>Params</em>
        and <em>Components</em>. The Ramboll Blog Tutorial got me into the
        <em>Curve</em> tab.  I'm normally very GUI-oriented, but getting more and
        more drawn to the "double-click and type" textual method.
      </p>

      <h3>Right Then, Let's Build Something!</h3>
      <p>
        I'll start with a gauge. It'll be nice have a middle slot that matches my
        caliper reading, and the rest auto-calculate like this:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic06-gauge-sketch.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>My first rectangle</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, let's go into Grashopper for real this time.  A couple number sliders
        a <em>Rectangle</em> component and ...
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic07-gauge-in-grasshopper.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>My first rectangle</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Now let's see if I can re-create ... THE NOTCH. Last time it was about
        0.3 inches. Use hard-coded number param, grab the rectangle dimentions,
        a bit of math, and ... I don't know why that was so hard. The bloody
        <em>Move</em> wouldn't work -- kept saying "this component is currently
        inactive." Finally I just went back to my in-class document, rejiggered
        it, and did a save as/overwrite of my original guage doc.  Whatever, it's
        working now.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Adding THE NOTCH</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, on to the main event, let's make the actual "gauge slots ..." well
        that was more complicated than I thought. Good thing I found the
        <em>Group</em> function or I'd be going nuts about now.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic09-gauge-add-caliper-slot.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Adding the Caliper slot</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Now let's get those other slots.  We want three above the middle "caliper
        slot", each of which 0.002 in. smaller than the previous.  Same thing below
        the middle one, but 0.002 larger.  Getting pretty hard to avoid a rats'
        nest ...
      </p>

        <figcaption>Hard to keep the wiring neat.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>...but it works!</p>

        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic11-gauge-add-caliper-3slot-rhino.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Got three slots though.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, three slots left ... we can do this.  Turned out to be ugly as hell ...
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic12-gauge-all-slots-grashopper.png" width=400>

      <p>Still works, though.</p>

        <figcaption>Not quite as ugly.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I thnk I figured out how to make it less crappy.  I used relays & <em>Scribbles</em>
        To label my inputs for the bottomost slot.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, all of last night in the
        <a href="https://reg.hfs.uw.edu/Program/GetProducts?productTypeCV=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000003502&classification=3e2e1a82-4f98-473b-b791-30ab7fe14c4c">

        </a>
        ended up being a massaive Grashopper CAD-fest.  Didn't print a darn thing.
        Ended up with a functional Guage, but the wiring was a complete and total
        rat's nest.  So how did I decide to start Day Four?  Plowing ahead with
        fillets and printing?  Oh no, I just had to fix those wires.  Pretty
        happy with the results, thought.

      <p>
        Grouping and labelling really helped. Each group is like its own little "chip"
        with specific inputs and outputs.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Relays helped, too. Easiest way was to (gasp!) unwire eveyrhting, then redo
        wires with relays, and little "label groups" that helped me keep my
        <em>Slot Depth, Caliper Slot Thickness, Slot Position Delta, Slot Size Delta</em>
        all straight.

      <h3>Good Wires, Good Rectangles, Time to Cut and Fillet</h3>

      <p>Let's try Gabi Duncome's advicd of Merging THE NOTCH and all the slots
        into one thing, then use Region Difference once.  Turns out I need to
        use Grashopper's funky <em>Zoomable User Interface (ZUI)</em> to add
        enough inputs. In my case, I need six.
      </p>

      <p>
        Huh, something was almost ... easy. My <em>Relay</em> game's solid
        enough that I could wire this up without rat-nesting again. Then I had
        to disable <em>Preview</em> on the intermediate shapes and ...
      </p>

        <figcaption>OMG, it Worked!  All that's left is to round some corners.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Finally, figured out how to <em>Fillet.</em> S'pose I could have gotten real
        fancy and only fillet the outer corners of the caliper slots, but I've had
        enough masochism on this assingment so I'm just going to fillet everytning
        and call it good.

      <h2>Oh Yeah, Printing ...</h2>
      <p>
        Got so excited seeing my complete geomety that I forgot there's even more
        to do before I can print.  Gotta dupe it so I have two, bake it, then do
        whatever else is needed to get the final rhino file ready for the
        laser-cutter.

      <div id="groups-and-relays">
        <p>
          First-off, let's dupe the gauge. This is actualy a good time to document
          the "Groups and Relays" technique I've developed to avoid rat-nesting. In
          this case, my goal is to have two copies, side-by side.  I know I'm going
          to need a <em>Linear Array</em> component and an <em>Unit X Vetor</em>. To
          avoid overlap, I need to use the width of the "Main Rectangle" I used when
          starting the guage. There' also going to be some multiplication involved,
          and ... I may as well ad control for the number of copies to make. Using
          <em>Relays</em>,  <em>Scribbles</em> the other elementes mentioned above,
          I can lay out the basic parts and group them.

          Yup, a lot of shuffling occurred already. With the internals squared away,
          <em>now</em> I can wire up the externals for the "Main Recangle width" and
          the "Finished Guage Geometry."

            All that work and I don't have a wing yet. Hope I can use that NACA

        <h3>Finally at the MILL,  Actual Measurements</h3>

        <p>
          Between my garage, the MILL, and (ahem) the Post Office, I've been able
          to scrounge up a healthy assortment of cardboard thicknesses and sizes.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Science Fair Tri-Fold</strong> Good spar material. A full
            <strong>36 inches</strong> wide and <strong>0.1465 inches</strong> thick.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Hunk of TV box </strong> Very strong, but not much left.
            <strong>25 x 13 inches</strong> area and a whopping
            <strong>.02725 inches</strong> thick.  Could make very strong but
            heavy airfoils. Curious to see how the laser cutter would handle this stuff.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>USPS Priority Mail Medium Flat Rate Box </strong> Appearently
            these are free if you visit your local post office after hours.
            <strong>20x15 inches</strong> overall, a mere <strong>0.0835 inches</strong>
            thick. Surprisingly stiff, could make good airfoils. Would push the
            limit of my gauge & slot cutting.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Joe Average Cardboard </strong> Plain, basic,
            <strong>31x18 inches</strong> overall, <strong>0.1590 inches</strong>
            thick.  Good backup matrial. Just-long enough to be a spar; stiff
            enough to be airfoils.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Thin Costco Cardboard </strong> Came "for free" with a few
            large flower pots my wife and I bought off a pallet.
            <strong>31x22 inches</strong> overall, <strong>0.1220 inches</strong>
            thick.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Okay, so given these choices, my order of preference is ...
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>0.1466 in.</strong> spar with
              <strong>0.0835 in.</strong> airfoil.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>0.1466 in.</strong> spar with
              <strong>0.2725 in.</strong> airfoil.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          So I need to generate three pairs of gauges for the three thicknesses.
        </p>
        <h3>Bake, Export, Print</h3>

        <p>
          Pull up my Grashooper doc, set the <strong>Caliper Slot</strong> to
          <strong>0.1466 in.</strong>
        </p>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>First real caliper measurement , set for 0.1466 in.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          After baking, I grab the "fresh" geomety, move it in X then
          set a new caliper thickness and rebake. Repeat until I have three
          gauge pairs.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Three pairs for three caliper measurments.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          For export, I had better luck going straight to Adobe Illustrator
          rather than through dxf. Only trick was to select 1 mm = 1 inch.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Export straight to AI, 1 mm = 1 inch.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Once in Adobe Illustrator a had to move the geometry from the
          bottom-left corner of the doc to upper-left, then resize the artboard
          to match my cardboard size, and set the stroke width to 0.001 in.
          Seem reasonable, especially  since I'll be resizing the AI doc for
          specific cardboard size, not to mention compensating for holes and other
          odd cardboard shapes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Okay, off to the laser cutter! First-up, Imma try my super thick TV
          box cardboard. Get the placment n the upper-left corner.

          Hm. even at full power, it didn't cut thru the tv box,
          stopping at the last layer. Looking at the dot pattern on the back

          refocused the laser when switching material thickness. Good thing
          the epilog is forgiving. About the same thinness as the usps box,
          but not nearly as stiff.

          Well, crap.  Almost all my gauge slots are too loose for everything.
          The only one that worked was for the regular science fair trifold
          cardboard.  Even then, it wasn't the middle slot that matched the
          calliper -- it was the smallest notch -- that was two "deltas"
          smaller.

      <p>
        So ... yeah, almost all my guage slots from yesterday are too big.
        Let's measure the actual gap size with calipers, and compare to what
        we see in Grasshopper.
      </p>
      <h3>Time to Play the Slots Again</h3>
      <p>
        My grashopper file was last used for the TV Box cardboard, so I'll

        the what actually got cut.

      <p>
        Well, no wonder -- I had my slot size delta set to a mere five one
        thousandth's of an inch! That's why they're so similar I can barely
        see a difference in the calipers.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic34-tiny-delta.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Only five-thousandth delta? So that's why id didn't work.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Now, about that one anomalous case that actually worked.  Yesterday,
        I had set the caliper measurement to 0.1465 which means the smallest
        measurement would have been 0.1365. In other words, I had to reduce my
        caliper measurment by 0.01 for a just-barely tight enough fit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>New Plan</strong> I'm going to use a delta of 0.02. Idealy,
        the smallest slot will be too small, and the middle or one the one
        just above or just below will fit. Also, re-measure the cardboard.
        This time, I took my caliper and measured each cardboard 3-5 times,
        looking for the smallest measurment that still fit.  Then, I scrolled
        up in this doc to look up yesterday's measurements.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr><th>Cardboard</th><th>Today's Measurment</th><th>Yesterday's Measurment</th></tr>

      </table>

      <p>
        So yeah, everything's waaayyyyy smaller than yesterday. Time to fire
        up Grashopper and re-run the bake export Adobe Epilog pipeline. This
        time, I'll use a size delta of <strong>0.05 in</strong> for the TV
        Box and Trifold, and  <strong>0.015 in</strong> for the super-thin USPS
        box.  Once again, I have six guages; but <em>this</em> time, I'm going
        to isolate each one to its own Adobe Illustrator layer, so I can print
        them one at a time, tinkering power/speed/frequency settings between
        runs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time around, I set the orientation correctly from the get-go.

        <strong>Try 12%.</strong>  Will the parts till fall out if I take it
        back up to 12%?  Yes!
      </p>

      <p><strong>Try 13%</strong> Still working, but resists a bit more.</p>
      <p><strong>Try 14%</strong>Still works.</p>

      <p>
        So, a speed of <strong>14</strong> cuts all the way though while
        providng a bit of a safety factor.

      <h3>Got Some New Slots, so How do they Fit?</h3>
      <p>
        Got another full set of six gauges.  Trying to fit against the super-thick
        TV Box, the regular-thick Science Fair Trifold, and the super-thin USPS
        box.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>TV Box.</strong> The middle slot fits, but not as tight as I
        would like (below). One shake makes it drop. The next slot up is too
        thin to fit at all. Everything else is loose enough for parts to fall
        out. I could go with this, or do one more (seriously?) guage with a
        smaller delta-thickness.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic40-TV-box-grip.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>It holds, as long as you don't shake it. At all.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>Science Fair Trifold</strong> The middle slot has the same "tight
        enough but almost too loose" feel as the TV Box case.  The next slot up
        (thinner) has a realy satisfying grip, holding up to vigorous shaking.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw02-pic41-trifold-grip.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>This is the grip I'm used to.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <strong>USPS Box</strong> I wouldn't trust the middle slot, but the next
        one up is very trustworthy. Totally shake-resistent. Almost feels like
        it was glued. Based on my Grashopper parameters, this slot is 0.0580 -
        0.0150 = <strong>0.0430 inches.</strong>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Feels like I glued it.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Okay, so What Thicknesses Are We Going to Use?</h3>

      <p>
        Gotta use the USPS cardboard. Thin, stiff, and we have an excellent
        slot width figured out.  Using the TV Box for spar Material is equaly
        irrestible -- really higlight the thickness difference. So we'll do
        big thick strong spars, with thin little slots. The airfoils wil be
        super thin, but with very wide slots.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, the next guage set will be cut in USPS cardboard. Last time 0.2530in
        was a tad too wide, and 0.2330 was hopelessly narrow. We could have the
        largest gap at 0.2500, and the smallest at 2400. A good sequence would
        be 2400, 2425, 2440, 2460, 2475, 2500, and who am I kidding I don't
        have time to keep tweaking this.
      </p>

      <h2> DAY SIX: I Can Haz Wing Now? </h2>
      <p>
        Four hours of build time left? I'm not worried at all. The slot for the
        large cardboard isn't perfect, but it should be enough for reasonaly
        shake resistant build.  Back on Day 4 I built an initial wing spar with
        a slot at each en, just need one more in the middle.  No time to use that
        Grashopper airfoil generator (sniff) so I'll just re-import the SVG one I
        used in homework two. Three ribs, Three spars, six parts, two thicknesses,
        good enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay, whipped out a center slot generator in short order without obsessing on
        perfect wiring.

      </figure>

      <p>
        No need to replicate the whole spar; I'll just generate one
        multiple times, adusting thickness and slot depth for each baking. On
        to the airfoil.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where I got quick, dirty, and way less parameterized. I had to
        abandon Dr. Peterson's NAC Airfoil Generator and import my own from
        Homework 1's Adobe Illustrator file. I tweaked around some of my
        Grashopper inputs to set the spar slot depth to just be one half
        of spar height.  Also added a Spar Cardboard thickness input. Now I can
        key in the thicknesses I gleaned from the Guage-Making Death March that
        consumed my whole week.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Input Mods</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I also added a module to generate the rectangluar slot that needs to be
        cut into the airfoils. To summarize:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spars will be cut from thick material. They will have narrow
          slots to accomodate the thin airfoils.
        </li>
        <li>
          Airfoils will be cut from thin material. They will have wide slots
          to accomodate the spars.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        So with that said, I basically just needed a rectangle component
        wired to the right inputs. I tried to get fancy connect it direclty
        to the airfoil geometry from Rhino, but couldn't get it to happen in
        time so I just went with the output of the Rectangle.

      <h3>Running Out of Time ...</h3>
      <p>
        Uh-oh. It's past 10:30. No time to do all the auto-repliaction I did
        for the gauge. Just going to bake, replicate, and bake again like this:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Start Rhino, import my NACA 2415 from Adobe Illustrator. When the AI
          Import options come up, <em>Preserve units</em> so 1 inch = 1 Rhino
          unit.

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        Scale the airfoil in Rhino and the spar height in Grashopper.
        Keep adjusting things until the proporation look about right.
        Airfoil a about 1 1/3 as thick as the spar.

        Go to Grashopper, right-click the output of the spar generator
        and select Bake.

      <li>
        Back to Grasshopper; but this time, bake the Airfoil slot (The
        rectangle not the failed attempt to region difference)

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        Now we get busy in Rhino.  Bake-and-move the airfoil slot thee more
        times for a total of for. Reposition the slots and the aorfiol.
        Rotate the slots around and line them up with the airfoil edge like
        this:

      </li>
      <li>
        At this point I would split trim, and fillet. But it's the eleventh
        hour (literally) and I'm having trouble remembering/finding the
        commands. Y'know what? I'll bet these notches will cut out just fine.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      What'd I tell you? No x-acto required.

    <p>
      Printing was somewhat uneventful. I used 100% power, 100% frequency at
      all times. Used 25% speed for the thin airfoils; 12% speed for the thick
      spars. Once agian, Layering in Adobe Illustrator let me control which
      parts get printed when, so I could print one at a time and adjust if
      needed. The wierdest thing was the draw order for the spars -- the line
      sequencing skipped around a bit, and the whole thing got lasered twice.
      No fires, but I had to wash my hands after handling them.

      Assembly was satifying, tight flush fits eveyrwhere ... until I
      figure out I had more slots than spars in the airfoil.
