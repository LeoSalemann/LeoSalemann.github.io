    <h2>Fixin' To Get Ready</h2>
    <p>
      Right, then.  We're supposed to re-create homework 1 parametrically,
      in <a href ="https://www.rhino3d.com/download">Rhino</a> with
      <a href ="https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/grasshopper">Grasshopper</a>.
      The basic idea is to parametrically handle arbitrary thicknesses, and
      to use two thicknesses in the actual build. I think Imma have to:
      <ol>
        <li>Draw some sketches.</li>
        <li>Watch some Grasshopper tutorials.</li>
        <li>CAD some stuff.</li>
        <li>Print some stuff.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Sketching</h2>
    <figure>

      <figcaption>Parts, Thicknesses, and Parameters</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay, so if I go with the original design, I have three parametric
      thicknesses at least:
      <ol>
        <li>Airfoil Thickness (T1)</li>
        <li>"Main Hoop" Thickness (T2)</li>
        <li>Spar Thickness (T3)</li>
      </ol>

      In reality, T1 will probably be pretty small, T3 will be bigger,
      and T2 will be huge. If I wanna go crazy, Each spar could be a
      unique thickness, so there'd be T1, T2, T3a, T3b, T3c.  It'd
      be a pain to gather so many material thicknesses, so I probalby
      won't actually go that far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing I could do is ditch the hoop entirely, and just go
      with notched beams at the leading and (maybe) trailind edges. It'd
      be interesting to see what it's like to assemble that way, and home
      strong the finished product is, so I'll probalby do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      So anyway, based on what little I know of Rhino Grasshopper, my
      visual programming diagram thingy would look somehting like this
      (below). To make things easier (and lighter!)  I've removed the
      "hoop frame" so I'm only dealing with spars and airfoils.
      Consequently, I no longer have to worry about T2 from the prior
      sketch, and can concentrate on T1 and T3.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've also added d1 and d3 so the cutout rectangles can have
      lengths to go width their widths. Rectangle A (for the spar)
      is d1 x T1; Rectangle B (for the airfoil a.k.a. rib) is d3 x T3.
      Spar height and airfoil height (I'll reserve "thickness" to
      describe material thickness" will both be d1+d3. When I work up
      spars for the other slot locations on the airfoil, the airfoil
      slots will always be d3 x T3, but the d1 used on the spars
      will vary.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quick rework of my 3-rib prototype suggests it'll still be
      plenty strong.

    </figure>

    <p>
      The tricky part in all this will be getting grasshopper to "read"
      my custom airfoil shape, cut notches in it, and replicate it. So
      having done this sketching, thinking, writing exercise, I know that
      I need tutorials covering:
      <ul>
        <li>Recangular Arrays</li>
        <li>Trimming</li>
        <li>Importing or referencing cusotom geometry</li>
      </ul>

      Spoiler alert: I already figured out how to import my SVG airfoil
      into Rhino!

      TBD - include links to what I whatched, and what I thought of them.
