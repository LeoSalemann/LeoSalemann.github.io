      <ul>
        <li>
          Beginner level 2-part silicone and clear epoxy are sticky but
          wonderfully odorless.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can never have too many disposable gloves, mixing sticks, or
          paper cups.
        </li>

        </li>

        <li>
          If you cut machinable was with a thin fast jigsaw, it will "self-heal"
          and melt itself back together. Slower bandsaws with broader blades work
          better.
        </li>

        <li>
          "Milling" grooves are easily cured with sandpaper therapy follwed by
          some heat gun love.
        </li>

        <li>
          Thick mold walls help resist heatgune smoothing and prying out the silicone.

    <h2>DAY ONE: Do I have the Right Stuff?</h2>
    <p>
      My OOMOO's going to be late so I bought Castn' Craft&reg; EasyMold&reg;
      from the Redmond Ben Franklin craft store. It's Silicone, it's a 1:1 mixture
      it will hopefully work.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic01-easy-mold.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>I think this will work ...</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Also unboxed my machinable wax.  It's about the right size in X and Y,
      but way too tall in Z.  Gonna need some bandsaw therapy.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic02-wax-unboxed.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>This aint' gonna work without cutting.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic03-wax-in-bantam.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Need to cut in half ... or maybe thirds.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <h3>Meausure Twice (or more); Cut Once (hopefully)</h3>
    <p>
      So for real, how many cuts to I need?
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>What the class BOM called for: <strong> 3" by 3" by 2"</strong></li>
      <li>What I bought: <strong> 3" by 3" by <em>3"</em></strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Okay, so either make a pair of 1.5" blocks, or a 2" that I use and a
      1" that I probalby throw away. How's it look in Bantam?
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic04-wax-bantam-measure.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>A pair of 1.5's or a two plust a one?</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      So a two inch high block will just <em>barely</em> fit; inch and a
      half is safe. A pair of 1.5's is look right from this perpective, now
      let's see about the bandsaw.
    </p>

    <h3>I Certifiably Have No Idea What I'm Doing</h3>
    <p>
      I need training & credentialing by specific MILL staff before I can use
      the bandsaw. MILL staff says anyone but Nick can provide bandsaw training,
      based on the schedule below.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic05-trainer-schedule.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Imma need someone on an evening or weekend.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay, so I can't cut anything tonight, but I can figure out how I
      <em>would</em> cut something. Linining up the wax block with the bandsaw
      blade silver line) and its clamp, a 1.5" cut doesn't leave much for the
      clamp to grab onto.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic06-bandsaw-cut-1.5.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Not sure about this ...</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Shaving off just one inch seems like the safer bet.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic07-bandsaw-cut-2.0.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Perhaps there's hope after all.</figcaption>
      </figure    a onkeypress=""

      <p>
        So in the end, it's up to the MILL trainer how I'm gonna cut this thing,
        but a 2" block with 1" waste is looking pretty good right now.
      </p>

    <div id="day-02">


      <h2>DAY TWO: A Sense of Panic Settles In Ahead of Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        Got certified on the MILL's bandsaw, but I can't cut antything until
        Monday during business hors.  Too late, too disruptive to my work schedule,
        Gotta buy wax from Fluke instead; can't do that until tomorow.
      </p>

      <h3>What am I Gonna Make, Anyway?</h3>
      <p>
        I was thinking a radial engine would be cool, especially if I cast in zinc
        instead of plaster. The geomtery's pretty tricky though. Even a "half engine"
        would involve all those cooling fins like a motorcycle.

        So maybe a "bubble canopy" would be easier. It'd look really good if I can cast
        in clear resin.  And If I wanna play hard-mode, I could make a two part mold and
        have a hollow canopy.

      <h3>Ok, Where Can I Find a Canopy?</h3>
      <p>
        Turns out standalone canopies are hard to find; it's a lot easier
        to find aircraft and hope I can slice the canopy off. As luck would
        have it (honestly, I <em>did not</em> plan this in advance)
        <a href ="https://free3d.com">free3d.com</a> has the same
        <a href ="https://free3d.com/3d-model/fighter-jet-sg-v1--213106.html">F-86</a>
        I found on wikimedia.

        <figcaption>This is encouraging,</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Making the box was fairly painless in Rhino. The real work was integratng
        the canopy. Download, unzip, import into Rhino. Rhino recongizes the obj
        file, and provides options to import by object and object names. Imma
        try that.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Not bad.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Now the crucial test  ... can I pull the canaopy off of the airplane?
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic11-f86-canopy-removed-rhino.png" width=800>
        <figcaption>Yes! Yeessss!!!</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Export the canopy as an obj. Go back to my box, and import the
        canopy. Mab OBJ Y to Rhino Z and I'm set.  Canopy's a little big.
        Translate and rotate to maneuver it over the box.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scale it down, translate it to the bottom of the box.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, if I can shave off the bottom I'm home free. Forget the 45
        degree rotation thing. Keep it orthongonal so it's easier to align
        the kinda curvy canopy bottom in pitch and without accidentally
        introducing roll.

      <h2>DAY THREE: Maybe I can Pull This Off After All</h2>
      <p>
        Bought a new block of wax at Fluke at 1.5" x 7" x 3". A Fluke staffer
        was kind enough to cut it for me, and I'm a terrible person for not
        catching his name for my <strong>Special Thanks</strong>
        section. Funny story: He first cut it with a jigsaw (thin blade, high
        speed) causing it to melt back together while still being cut. A broader,
        slower bandsaw blade did the trick. So now I have an actually millable
        block (two, in fact) and I just need to re-synch my CAD files with the
        new block size. But first, I want to think about casting materials.
      </p>

        <figcaption>This is more like it.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>A Clear Alternative That's Not Set in Stone</h3>

      <p>
        Rather than plaster, I'd like to cast my canopy in something clear. My
        EasyMold&reg; box advertises EasyCast&reg;, a  clear epoxy/resin combo.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic19-castin-craft-clear-epoxy.png" width=800>
        <figcaption>I feel a shopping spree coming on...</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        A review of the EasyMold&reg; material data
        sheet & instructions shows me it's possible. It'll require heat cure
        <em>or</em> extended 24-hour curing time.  I can wait; don't wanna
        introduce resins into my kitchen oven. Another
        cool trick I just picked up from the MDS:
        <blockquote>
          For block molds you can measure how much silicone you'll need by pouring
          dry rice (or something similar) into your mold, then transferring it
          into a measuring cup.
        </blockquote>
        Half the measurement tells you how much part A and part B you need!
      </p>

      <h3>Shopping Spree!</h3>
      <p>
        Ran out to my local (Issaquah) Micheal's found both Castin' Craft's&reg;
        EasyCast&reg; as well as Clear Polyester.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic20-clear-choices.png" width=800>
        <figcaption>Decisions, decisions ... </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        EasyCast&reg; is cheaper and simpler but the dry times could be up to
        three days. The other one seems like it will cure faster, but trickier
        mixing in a complicated multi layer pour. I’m going to buy the cheaper
        one and get my mold ready ASAP. If I run out of time I’ll come back
        for the polyester.
      </p>

      <div id="schedule">
        <h3>Schedule Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          The assignment calls for making 4 finished pieces. I have both EasyMold&reg;
          (silicone) and EasyCast&reg; (clear epoxy/resin) now, so I’ll make mulitiple
          silicone molds to let me cast mulitiple pieces imultaneously. Everything
          takes an overnight or full day to Cara, so I should be able to buy more
          material at local stores  if I’m running short.  My casting schedule will
          probably look something like this (below). Assuming I can cast my first
          silicone mold on Sunday, I'll have one silicone mold ready on Monday,
          and zero finished canopies. Buy Tuesday I'll have two molds and one
          canopy. Moving through the week ...

          Okay, so I should have all the canopies I need by Thursday May 23, for
          an assingment that's due Sunday, May 26.

      <h3>Rescale for New Wax</h3>
      <p>
        I have a new wax block since last time, and I never was able to generate
        g-code from Fustion 360.  Back to Rhino, rebuild my mold. Easiest way I
        could find was to do it from scratch, since it's just two rectangles, a
        couple extrusions, and an imported shape.  Upon close inspection, my
        Rhino units are actually milimeters, so Imma go with that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Make an outer rectangle starting at <strong>(0,0)</strong> with length
        <strong>88</strong> and width <strong>78</strong> based on caliper
        measurements. Five milimeters makes for a good wall thinkness and easy
        math. Inner rectangle starts at <strong>(5,5,5)</strong> with length
        <strong>78</strong> and width <strong>68</strong>. Extrude the outer
        rectangle by <strong>39</strong> (from caliper). Extrude inner recangle
        by the same to ensure overlap for a "clean subtraction." Cap and do a
        BooleanDifference.

        Rhino -> STL -> Fusion 360 was pretty easy, although fusion deciced
        to scale my model 10X. No problem, easily corrected.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Fusion thought it would be a good idea to ignore the fact that one corner of
        my model was already at <strong>(0,0,0)</strong>, and left me with something
        in negative X and Y, hovering way up in positive Z.

        suggests the tool might be trying to go "under" my
        canopy. Perhaps I need to embed it deeper and try again.  I actually
        want a "shallower" mold so I can use less silicone. Here we go with
        try #3.  Take the canopy from here ...

        Now bring the bottom of the box up plenty high, making sure to bury

        Okay back to the Extrude -> Cap -> STL -> Fussion workflow.  Let's see
        how it turns out this time.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where I started thrashing around a bit.  Got the same error
        so I had to sink the canopy even further. Got some wierd "bottom
        cannot be above top" errors, and made these changes.

      <p>
        On about the third try, I got valid toolpaths and a successful
        simulation.

      <h3>Home with the HeatGun</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, I'm back from Fluke. First thing imma do, is see if I can smooth
        out these scratches with my heat gun ... wihout turnning my hard-earned
        mold into a puddle of blue despondence. Time for for some light reading!
        First-up, the heat gun:

        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic41-heatgun-label.png" width=800>
        <figcaption>375 &#8451; eh? That seems hot.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Lowest setting is 375 &#8451;. Good to know. Moving on to machinable wax,
        their tech specs at
        <a href ="https://www.machinablewax.com/technical.php">
          https://www.machinablewax.com/technical.php
        </a>
        says it melts at 116 &#8451;.  Uh-oh, gotta be careful with this.
      </p>

      <h3>Let's Try an Experiment</h3>
      <p>
        The thickest part of my mold is on the bottom.  So I'll flip it, scuff it,
        and try to melt the scuffs out.

      <h2>DAY SIX: First Canopy</h2>
      <p>
        Canopy hardened enough to pop out after around 24 hours, but it's still
        soft enough to bend. It’s perfectly dry, though. The good news is I can
        reuse the mold tonight.

      <p>
        Second silicone mold popped right out with less trouble than the first one.
        Add some release conditioner to both. While that's drying, mix up my
        third batch of silicone so I have a third on the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a long dinner break, the molds have two coats of conditioner on them
        and it’s time to pour new canopies. I've got better measuring cups now.
        Remembering last night's mistake, I'll keep it to around 5 ml in each cup.
