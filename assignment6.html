    <h2>DAY ONE: Do I have the Right Stuff?</h2>
    <p>
      My OOMOO's going to be late so I bout Castn' Craft EasyMold from
      Redmond Ben Franklin craft store. Its Silicone, it's a 1:1 mixture it
      will hopefully work.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic01-easy-mold.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>I think this will work ...</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Also unboxed my machinable wax.  It's about the right size in X and Y,
      but way too tall in Z.  Gonnad need some bandsaw therapy.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic02-wax-unboxed.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>This aint' gonna work without cutting.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic03-wax-in-bantam.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Need to be cut in half ... or maybe thrids.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <h3>Meausure Twice (or more); Cut Once (hopefully)</h3>
    <p>
      So for real, how many cuts to I need?
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>What the class BOM called for: <strong> 3" by 3" by 2"</strong></li>
      <li>What I bought: <strong> 3" by 3" by <em>3"</em></strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Okay, so either make a pair of 1.5" blocks, or a 2" that I use and a
      1" that I probalby throw away. How's it look in Bantam?
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic04-wax-bantam-measure.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Need to be cut in half ... or maybe thrids.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      So a two inch high block will just <em>barely</em> fit; inch and a
      half is safe. A par of 1.5's is look right from this perpective, now
      let's see about the bandsaw.
    </p>

    <h3>I Certifiably Have No Idea What I'm Doing</h3>
    <p>
      I need training & credentialing by specific MILL staff before I can use
      the bandsaw. MILL staff says anyone but Nick can provide bandsaw training,
      based on the schedule below.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic05-trainer-schedule.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Imma need someone on an evening or weekend.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay, so I can't cut anything tonight, but I can figure out how I
      <em>would</em> cut something. Linining up the wax block with the bandsaw
      blade silver line) and its clamp, a 1.5" cut doesn't leave much for the
      clamp to grab onto.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic06-bandsaw-cut-1.5.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Not sure about this ...</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Shaving off just one inch seems like the safer bet.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic07-bandsaw-cut-2.0.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Perhaps there's hope after all.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      So in the end, it's up to the MILL trainer how I'm gonna cut this thing,
      but a 2" block with 1" waste is looking pretty good right now.
    </p>

  <!-- ***************  DAY TWO  *************** -->
  <div id="day-02">


    <h2>DAY TWO: A Sense of Panic Settles In Ahead of Schedule</h2>
    <p>
      Got certified on the MILL's bandsaw, but I can't cut antything until
      Monday during business hors.  Too late, too disruptive to my work schedule,
      Gotta buy wax from Fluke instead; can't do that until tomorow.
    </p>

    <h3>What am I Gonna Make, Anyway?</h3>
    <p>
      I was thinking a radial engine would be cool, especially if I cast in zinc
      instead of plaster. The geomtery's pretty tricky though. Even a "half engine"
      would involve all those cooling fins like a motorcycle.
    </p>

      So maybe a "bubble canopy" would be easier. It'd look really good if I can cast
      in clear resin.  And If I wanna play hard-mode, I could make a two part mold and
      have a hollow canopy.

    <h3>Ok, Where Imma Find a Canopy?</h3>
    <p>
      Turns out standalone canopies are hard to find; it's a lot easier
      to find aircraft and hope I can slice the canopy off. As luck would
      have it (honestly, I <em>did not</em> plan this in advance)
    </p>


    <p>
      Making the box was fairly painless in Rhino.
      <a href ="https://free3d.com">free3d.com</a> has the same
      <a href ="https://free3d.com/3d-model/fighter-jet-sg-v1--213106.html">F-86</a>
      I found on wikimedia.

    </figure>

    <p>
      Download, unzip, import into Rhino. Rhino recongizes the obj file,
      and provides options to import by object and object names. Imma
      try that.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Not bad.</figcaption>

    <p>
      Now the crucial test  ... can I pull the canaopy off of the airplane?

      <figcaption>Yes! Yeessss!!!</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Export the canopy as an obj. Go back to my box, and import the
      canopy. Mab OBJ Y to Rhino Z and I'm set.  Canopy's a little big.
      Translate and rotate to maneuver it over the box.
    </p>

      Scale it down, translate it to the bottom of the box.

      <figcaption>Lined up at the bottom.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Okay, if I can shave off the bottom I'm home free. Forget the 45
      degree rotation thing. Keep it orthongonal so it's easier to align
      the kinda curvy canopy bottom with pitch and without accidentally
      introducing roll.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Now</em> Rotate the canopy 45 degrees. Export to stl, load into

    </figure>

    <p>
      A quick <strong>Inspect > Measure</strong> in Fusion 360 shows my

  <div id="day-03">
    <h2>DAY THREE: Maybe I can Pull This Off After All</h2>
    <p>
      Bought a new block of wax at Fluke at 1.5" x 7" x 3". A Fluke staffer
      was kind enough to cut it for me, and I'm a terrible person for not
      catching his name and including him in my <strong>Special Thanks</strong>
      section. Funny story: He first cut it with a jigsaw (thin blade, high
      speed) causing it to melt back together while still being cut. A broader,
      slower bandsaw blade did the trick. So now I have an actually millable
      block (two, in fact) and I just need to re-synch my CAD files with the
      new block size. But first, I want to think about casting materials.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic18-new-blocks.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>This is more like it.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>A Clear Alternative That's Not Set in Stone</h3>

    <p>
      Rather than plaster, I'd like to cast my canopy in something clear. My
      <em>EasyMold</em> by <em>Castn'Craft</em> advertises a Clear
      Expoxy/Resin combo.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic19-castin-craft-clear-epoxy.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>I feel a shopping spree coming on...</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      A review of the <em>EasyMold</em> material data
      sheet & instructions shows me it's possible. It'll require heat cure
      <em>or</em> extended 24-hour curing time.  I can wait; don't wanna
      introduce resins into my kitchen oven. Another
      cool trick I just picked up from the MDS:
      <blockquote>
        For block molds you can measure how much silicone you'll need by pouring
        dry rice (or something similar) into your mold, then transferring it
        into a measuring cup.
      </blockquote>
      Half the measurement tells you how much part A and part B you need!
    </p>

    <h3>Shopping Spree!</h3>
    <p>
      Ran out to my local (Issaquah) Micheal's found both Castin' Craft's
      <em>EasyCast</em> as well as Clear Polyester.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic20-clear-choices.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Decisions, decisions ... </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      <em>EasyCast</em> is cheaper and simpler but the dry times could be up to
      three days. The other one seems like it will cure faster, but trickier
      mixing in a complicated multi layer pout. I’m going to buy the cheaper
      one and get my mold ready ASAP. If I run out of time I’ll come back
      for the polyester.
    </p>

    <div id="schedule">
      <h3>Schedule Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        The assignment calls for making 4 finished pieces. I have both cast
        and craft and remove cats now, so I’ll make for a silicone molds so I
        can make all my casting simultaneously. Everything takes an overnight
        or full day to Cara, so I should be able to buy more material at local
        stores  if I’m running short.  My casing schedule will probably look
        something like this, assuming I can cast my first silicone mold on
        Sunday, I'll have one silicone mold ready on Monday, and zero finished
        canopies.
      </p>

      <table >

      <p>
        Okay, so I should have all the canopies I need by Thursday May 23, for
        an assingment that's due Sunday, May 26.

    <h3>Rescale for new wax.</h3>
    <p>
      I have a new wax block since last time, and I never was able to generate
      g-code form Fustion 360.  Back to Rhino, rebuild my mold. Easiest way I
      could find was to do it from scratch, since it's just two rectangles, a
      couple extrusions, and an imported shape.  Upon close inspectin, my
      Rhino units are actually milimeters, so Imma go with that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Make an outer rectangle starting at <strong>(0,0)</strong> with length
      <strong>88</strong> and width <strong>78</strong> based on caliper
      measurements. Five milimeters makes for a good wall thinkness and easy
      math. Inner rectangle starts at <strong>(5,5,5)</strong> with length
      <strong>78</strong> and width <strong>68</strong>. Extrude the outer
      rectangle by <strong>39</strong> (from caliper). Extrude inner recangle
      by the same to ensure overlap for a "clean subtraction." Cap and do a
      BooleanDifference.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic21-new-box.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>That didn't take long.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Add the canopy again, scale, move and rotate like last time.
    </p>

      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic22-new-mold.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>There, back to normal.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Rhino -> STL -> Fusion 360 was pretty easy, although fusion deciced
      to scale my model 10X. No problem, easily corrected.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Fusion though it would be a good idea to ignore the fact that one corner of
      my model was already at <strong>(0,0,0)</strong>, and left me with something
      in negative X and Y, hovering way up in positive Z.

      suggests the tool might be trying to go "under" my
      canopy. Perhaps I need to embed it deeper and try again.  I actually
      want a "shallower" mold so I can use less silicone. Here we go with
      try #3.  Take the canopy from here ...

      Now bring the bottom of the box up plenty high, making sure to bury
      all the wierd curves and overhangs on the bottom of the canoyp.

    <p>
      Okay back to the Extrude -> Cap -> STL -> Fussion workflow.  Let's see
      how it turns out this time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where I started thrashing around a bit.  Got the same error
      so I had to sink the canopy even further. Got some wierd "bottom
      cannot be above top" errors, and made these changes.

    <p>
      On about the third try, I got valid toolpaths and a successful
      simulation.

      Pulling the g-code into Bantam naturally caused a wild offest.

    <p>
      But after the usual ajustments, Bantam said It could be done in
      2 hours and 3 minutes.

      Turning off the tool paths shows I'm gonna have a highly countoured
      canopy.  Should I dare try 1/16 bit?  Maybe tomorrow.

      Rough cut turned out ... rough. Next time I'll plan for thicker walls,
      to allow more leeway with block size and placement.

      Looks like a canopy after the finishing pass. Also give it a little glue

      Some quality time with 300-grit sandpaper addressed the countours. Will
      probably try a heat gun to get it back to a glass finish.

    <h3>Home with the HeatGun</h3>
    <p>
      Okay, I'm back from Fluke. First thing imma do, is see if I can smooth
      out these scratches with my heat gun ... wihout turnning my hard-earned
      mold into a puddle of blue despondence. Time for for some light reading!
      First-up, the heat gun:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic41-heatgun-label.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>375 &#8451; eh? That seems hot.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Lowest setting is 375 &#8451;. Good to know. Moving on to machinable wax,
      their tech specs at
      <a href ="https://www.machinablewax.com/technical.php">
        https://www.machinablewax.com/technical.php
      </a>
      says it melts at 116 &#8451;.  Uh-oh, gotta be careful with this.
    </p>

    <h3>Let's Try an Experiment</h3>
    <p>
      The thickest part of my mold is on the bottom.  So I'll flip it, scuff it,
      and try to melt the scuffs out.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Gotta be careful, but it can be done..</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <h3>Moving on to The Main Event</h3>
    <p>
      Heatunning the canopy worked well for the most part ..
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic45-canopy-heatgunned.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>Pretty good ... </figcaption>

    <p>
      Except for some stubborn grooves at the very edge.

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic46-canopy-remaining-grooves.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>... but maybe a little more. </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      More scuffing, more melting, less courage, less patience ...
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic47-canopy-remoothed.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>
        Okay I'm stopping now.  That wall near the top is getting awfully thin.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>




    <h3>First Pour</h3>
    <p>
      Start with a volume test, in this case some stee-cut oats. Fill the
      mold ...
    </p>

    <p>
      ... transfer to measuring cup.

      <img src ="img/hcde598-hw06-pic49-measured-volume.png" width=800>
      <figcaption>... now I am.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Two ounces, how convenient. Transfer to a couple paper cups, mark the
      fill lines.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Done with oats; ready for silicone.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Pour out an Part A and B from the EasyMold package, using the recently
      Sharpied fill lines. Pretty goopy stuff, glad I'm using disposables.

      <figcaption>No major messes so far.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Mix, pour, and ... bubbles ... plus some uneven color.  I'll try to mix
      more throughly tomorrow, but I'll take my changes with this one for
      tonight.
