        <h3>Inches or Millimeters?</h3>
        <p>
          I started by charging off in inches, mostly based of the bed sizes
          of the epilog lasers. The thought occurs my careful notch work from

          <a href = "assignment3.html#millimeters"> Assignment 3 (Airfoil Lamp) </a>

          was in millimeters.  Also I'm having scaling problems when I go from Adobe
          Illustrator into Rhino anyway. Grashopper Airfoil generator wants
          millimeters, Dremel 3D wants millimeters, Adobe Illstrato can be converted.
          Take a deep breath, go back to Illustrator, re-do my dimentions in mm.

          workflow. Measure wing in Rhino; compare to AI.

            Dr. Paterson's airfoil generator from assignment 3
          </a>
          , line up the airfoil from the Tomahawk plans and roll my own. Start with
          the 129mm chord length measured from the plans, and set the thicknness
          to 20/129 = 15.5% of chord.  I can actually get pretty close.

        <p>
          Bake the airfoil, move it over by the traced fuselage, line up for
          horizontal stabilizer.  Here's my next "cheat." To avoid having to cut
          v-notches to prevent the elevator and rudder from interfering, I'm
          going to just extend the chord so the elevator portion simply overhangs
          the vertical tail. If I set my rudder the right way, no interferance
          (I hope.)

        <p>
          On to the wing spars, regenerating for millimeters.  Use the
          <a href = "assignment3.html#day-07">
            spar generator from Assignment 3
          </a>
          , but first
          <strong>think about cardboard thickness.</strong>
          In Assignment 3, all the cardboard was the us postal stuff. This time,
          the airfoils will still be the USPS thin cardboard, while the spars
          will be science fair trifold or somtehing similar. So, the slots
          cut into the spar will be thin, to accmodate the airfoils.
          <em>I can use the slot thicknesses from Assignment 3.</em>
          The slots cut into the airfoils will be thick, to accmodate the thick
          spar.  I might be able to dig up the thickness from one of my early gauge
          studies, but I can worry about that later.  Important thing is I can
          <em>
            use the Assignment 3 spar generator with its existing slot
            dimensions
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Turns out the Spar generator actually operates in inches, but it kinda
          doesn't matter.  I can prettymuch "eyeball it" to get the spar lengh
          to agree with the wing span on the original plan.
        </p>

            Hope this works.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Similarly, I can compare it to the airfoil I just made to make sure
          the spar is narrow enough.
        </p>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>
            Hmmm ... pretty thin-looking spar.

        <p>
          I gonna probalby hafta do some prelminary laser cuts pretty soon.
          But first imma thinken the spar, then just be more careful where I
          place along the airfoil profile.

        <p>
          Bake, and move on to the elevator spar.  This one looks small enough
          that I can probalby use USPS cardboard for the spar as well as airfoils.

        An evening appointment went longer than planned, no time to CAD tonight.
        All I can do is plan for tomorrow and the weekend.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Use an even number of airfoils, not odd.</strong>
        I had a plan to cut some lightening holes in the fuselage, and sort of
        "carve out" airfoil shapes to match the wing and horizontal stablizer.
        Forget that. Use an <em>even number</em> of airfoils, then shape the
        fuselage with an "airfoil-shaped dent" with notches for the spars to
        slide in.  Notches should only be on the fuselage side, so the wing can
        slide left and right as necessary for centering.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Friday's for Cadding Cardboard</strong>
        Ignore <em>all</em> the moving control surfaces.  First get "fixed"
        wing and stablizer done.  Do some slot-test studies for
        cardboard-to-arcryllic. Do slot & hole studies with FR-1.

        <h3>7:19 PM First Thing, Let's CAD That Stabilizer</h3>
        <p>
          It's a simple little wing, all made with USPS cardboard.  Should
          go quick, so let's get on with it. First-off, redo the spar because
          (a) I lost my save from last time and (b) I need to re do it for an
          even number of airfoils anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Can I do the Extrusion in OnShape?</strong>
          Wonder if I can export the 2d curves as their own 3dm's for OnShape,
          rather than extrude and cap in Rhino like last time.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src ="img/hcde598-hw08-pic19-stabilizer-2d-in-onshape.png" width=800>
          <figcaption>OMG It Worked!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Actually, yes!  I'm gonna do it again though, this time moving it to
          origin in Rhino first, and naming it stabilizer-horiz-airfoil so
          my names will sort nicely when I add a spar, and when I deal with
          vertical vs. horizontal stabilizers.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Perfection.</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>
          So it looks like extruding in Rhino is easier after all. A 2D import
          into OnShape leaves me with a plain curve that I can't turn into a sketch or
          do anything useful with.  Extruded Rhino files come in as actual Parts
          which can be dimensioned.  Dimensions seem to check out. I just need to
          convert 0.138 inches
          (<a href = "assignment3.html#machine-settings">"Notch Size" from Assignment 3</a>)
          to 3.482 mm.
        </p>

          <figcaption>More perfecter.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Okay, <em>now</em> move the spar over to origin in Rhino, extrude by
          3.482 mm, and import into OnShape. Now let's see if I can cut
          notches in OnShape instead of Rhino.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Or, Maybe Not.</strong> I can't find anything that will
          "cut" one 3d shape from another.  Back to Rhino.  Use my spar
          generator to bake an "airfiol slot." Line them up at varous ponints
          along the stabilizer airfoil curve. No trims, no cuts, nothing fancy.
          Just let the lasercutter do that part. Export to ai format,
          1mm = 1mm.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looks like the scaling held together.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Maybe this will work.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Copy, paste move a few times so I have multiple spars and airfoils.
          Need to group the slots with the airfoil (feels lame, I should probaby
          trim in Rhino like an adult).  Bunch everything up tight in one corner
          to conserve cardboard. Just doing a test-fit at this point.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Turned out okay.  That's reassuring.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src ="img/hcde598-hw08-pic24-stabilizer-irl.png" width=800>
          <figcaption>Looks like I still got it.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          I'm starting to re-think my chord length, though. These airfoils
          don't fit cleanly on stndard FR1.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src ="img/hcde598-hw08-pic25-stabilizer-on-FR1.png" width=800>
          <figcaption>Maybe smaller?</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Sure, I could get <em>one</em> airfoil out of FR-1 if I lay it
          diagonally, but I could get 2 or three if I just shorten it a
          smidge. On the other hand, I have 20 FR1's with plenty more unused
          on the "share shelf."  So I'll move on to other issues and consider
          shortening the airfoils later.

      <div id="day-03-10:34pm-wing">
        <h3>10:34pm On to the Main Wing</h3>
        <p>
          First decision is whether to use science fair trifold or some new
          cardboard I got form an ultrawide PC monitor. At frist I was temped
          to stick with the trifold since I had used in my gauge studies from
          <a href ="assingment2.htm.">Assingment 2</a>, but I didn't really record
          what thickness actually worked (shame on me!).  Also, the PC monitor
          box cardboard is so much stiffer, I can't really turn it down. It's
          caliper and gauge-making time.
        </p>


        <p>
          <strong>Slot thicknesses and Unit Wierdness</strong>
          Okay, let's think this through. I'm <em>trying</em> to go pure
          milimeters, but I already kinda cheated with the horizontal stabilizer
          since it the slot widths were already dialed in for USPS cardboard
          and it was using inches. Now I'm about to make a wing <em>spar</em> that's
          much thicker than the USPS cardboard, while the wing <em>airfoils</em>
          are still USPS cardboard. So the <em>thick spar</em> will have
          <em>thin slots</em> cut into it for accomodating <em>thin airfoils,</em>
          while the <em>thin airfoils</em> will have <em>thick slots</em> cut into
          them for accomdating the <em>thick spar</em>.
        </p>


        <p>
          <strong>And Another Thing</strong>
          <em>All slots</em> whether for airfoil or spar, come form the
          my Grashopper spar generator, which operates in inches. So the
          path of least resistance is ...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Set the caliper for inches, measure cardoard.</li>
          <li>Use my older inches-based gauge generator.</li>
          <li>Use the existing inches-based spar generator.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While the path to righteousness would entail ...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Set the caliper for inches, measure cardoard.</li>
          <li>Use my newer metric gauge generator.</li>
          <li>Modify the spar generator to take metric inputs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I have plenty of other things to modify. Gonna stay on the dark
          side and set the caliper for inches.
        </p>


        <p>
          <strong>So many thicknesses to choose from.</strong>
          Turns out different parts of that monitor box are different
          thicknesses. The biggest piece is 0.1570 inches to 0.1805, depending
          on where you measure and whether you take a "deep bite" with the
          calipers or only "nibble" with the tips. So given that my gauge
          generator can make five slots.  I'm gonna set the middle
          <strong>caliper slot</strong> to <strong>0.1600</strong>, and the
          <strong>Slot size</strong> to <strong>0.0100</strong> that should
          give me slots of
          <strong>0.1400, 0.1500, 0.1600, 0.1700, and 0.1800.</strong>

        <h3>Oops</h3>
        <p>
          The actual slot thickness is 0.043. I messed up my earlier OnShape
          extrusions. That's why the airfoil looked so mutch thicker than its
          "spar slots"

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Elevator spar should not have slots.</strong>
            The arfoils need to slide so they can butt right up against the
            horizontal stabilizer to accept a "pin hinge."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan for Wire Landing Gear Axle</strong>
            Ideally the wire thickness would match the USPS cardbaord, so I
            can re-use the 3d printed slot from assingment 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maybe forzen lolipop landing gear.</strong>
            Could take the T-sticks from Assingment 3 and replace the T
            with a disk.  Boom! Easy but lame landing gear.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maybe prop shaft</strong>
            This would be 3d-printed, and look kind of like a giant
            arrow-shaped push rivet.  Will probably require multiple prints
            and tests, though.

          Lots of variables to consider with wheels. Wheel diameter,

          Grab a bunch of wheels walk over to the metal wire selection to
          find an axle.
          Found a brass hollow tube at 1/16 inch diameter, matches one of the
          one of the wheels I found, snugly fits into then 3D printed struts
          I brought with me. Some wheels mark their axle size in fractional
          inches, some in decimal inches, some in milimeter. Delightful.
          Google tells me 1/16 inch = 0.0625 inch = 1.588 millimeters. No
          other wheels in my favoorite axle size.

          Going to buy 3/32 axle and wheel as well, so have the possibility

          This should be straightforward, I know what I need and how big
          it should be.

          Minor hiccup, they gave me extruded acrylic instead of cast, which was
          covered in plastic film instead of paper tape looking stuff.
          I was worried about the horror stories of uneven thickness, so I
          asked for a cast instead and TAP was awesome. They took the extruded
          one back even after being cut, and all I had to do was pay the
          difference for the cast piece.

          <strong>Now, about that gauge ...</strong>

        <p>
          <strong>A cunning plan for landing gear integration.</strong>
          The landing gear is going to re-use the struts I made in
          <a href ="assignment3.html#finished-struts">
            Assingment 3
          </a>
          , they'll just be shorter and have a slot at each end. The key
          thing is, the wing spars will be <em>thick PC monitor cardboard</em>
          wile the landing gear attaches to <em>thin USPS cardboard</em>.
          So, I'm going to have a "secondary spar" made of USPS cardboard
          for the landing gear to clip on to. The key point here is for this
          spar to be <em>slotless</em> so I don't have to worry about perfectly
          aligning slots between to different spar lenghts and types types.
          Time to open up Rhino and CAD something up.
        </p>

        <p>
          Copy one of the slots from the horizontal stabilizer airfoil, copy
          to the main wing airfoil. Hand-build a rectangle that matches the
          dimentions of the horizontal stabilizer.
        </p>

          My slot opened up in the queue, time to go. Load up the PC Monitor
          cardboard, key in my favorite settings.

          Curious.  Usually it's the smaller gaps that fit best, but this time
          it was the biggest.  No matter, I'll take it. It's a good snug fit.

          <strong>Pivot Back to Inches(?)</strong>
          Airfoil was in millimeters, gauge generator's in inches,
          spar generator's in inches. Really shoulda spent some time
          converging to mm, but the path of least resistance (cringe) is
          to convert my rhino document to inches.  Save a copy of try04
          as try05.
        </p>

        <p>
          The deed is done.  Now I should be able to make a 12.0 by 0.5 inch
          rectangle for the "landing gear spar" Then make a 0.5 by 0.043 inch
          airfoil slot. It worked, but I don't like how deep it's cutting
          into the airfoil.

          Let's freehand an airfoil slot rectangle, to dial in the
          "airfoil depth." Here's a good depth - 0.45 inches. Works for
          about the first third of the chord lenth.

          Now I should be able to make a 12.0 by 0.45 inch
          rectangle for the "landing gear spar" Then make a 0.45 by 0.043 inch
          airfoil slot. In another attempt to be clever, I'm going to have
          a forward "landing gear spar" for tail-dragger "big wheels in front"
          as well as a 45-degree canted spar for tricycle-style "big wheels in back."

        <p>
          Ok, we've got all the wing compeonents in Rhino, let's migrate
          to Adobe Illusrator and prep for lasercutting. Rhino seems to resent
          the unit conversion as much as I do, and has decided to make things
          difficult when I export curves from Rhino to Adobe Illustrator. Gotta
          twiddle the knobs and find what works.

          <ul>
            <li>inches-to-inches: nope</li>
            <li>inches-to-mm(1to1): exists, but tiny</li>
            <li>inches-to-mm(1to25.4); nope </li>
          </ul>

          To heck with exporting to illustrator; let's try dxf.

          <ul>
            <li>Try dxf (CAM Imperial) instead: works but tiny</li>
            <li>Try dxf (CAM Imperial) Sale 25.4 units = 1 mm: super-tiny</li>
            <li>Try dxf (CAM Imperial) Sale 25.4 units = 1 mm: <strong>frickn' finally.</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, we've got one of each major part in Illustrator - wing spar,
          wing airfoil, and landing gear spar. Now that we're in Illustrator,
          we'll group, copy, and past to make multiples and lay them out in a
          way that's optimal to the material we're cutting and what's been
          cut before on it. After multiple rounds of copy, paste, and transform;
          my layour for the next USPS session looks like this (below.) I've also
          segregated groups into layers, so I can cut a few pieces, confrim the
          fit, then cut the rest.
        </p>

            Previous horizontal stabilizer parts, already cut (magenta);
            Initial spar and airfoil (cyan); Next airfoil and spar (yellow);
            all remaining airfoils (black and gray)
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>Okay, let's cut!</strong>
          Start thick PC Monitor cardboard,cut a wing spar. Turns out
          10% speed was too fast for some parts of the spar, but it can still
          be punched out. Switch to USPS cardboard to print an initial foil and
          landing gear spar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn the speed back up to 25%. USPS parts cut fine (though I forgot to
          refocus the laser - oops.)
          The initial test fit (one main spar, one airfoil, one landing gear spar)
          checks out, so print the rest of the USPS parts.  While that's cutting,
          jump back to the Ilustrator file for the main wing spare and make two
          more (shame on me for not doing that before approaching the printer).
          No matter, the new file was ready before the SUSPA parts finished cutting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reload the PC Monitor cardboard. Drop the speed to 8% this time, cut
          two more spars.  Much better. Put it all together and ...
        </p>

            Now I have a wing.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Okay, it works and passes the shake test. Fairly happy with the fit,
          but if I have time to cut another (yeah, right) I'll increase the main
          spar height, and cut the airfoil slots a little deeper on the leading
          edge.

          The final fuselage will be in arcryllic, but the first cut(s)
          will be in cardboard. The whole reason I chose a piper Tomahawk
          is because the wing attaches right to the bottom of the fuselage
          and the horizontal stabilizer attaches right to the top of the tail.
          So the top of the tail will need to be shaped kinda like half an
          airfoil, and have USPS-sized slots cut in it, ready to receive the
          spars from the horizontal stabilizer.

        <p><strong>Prep the Fuselage</strong>
          Make copyies of the airfoils and move them away from the fuselage to
          keep them safe.  For the ones still touching the fuslage, ungroup
          the  airfoil from their various spar cutouts.  Delete the foils and
          uncessary cutouts, so only the slots relevant to the fuselage remain.

          The Trick is to use Rhinos <em>Scale1D</em> command while enabling
          <em>point</em> in the <em>OnSnap</em> tab at the bottom. Click one
          corner of the rectangular slot for the base point, then the next
          point in the direction you want to scale.

          <strong>Ok, so for real now; which cardboard?</strong>
          I'm not ready to use prime PC monitor cardboard on this yet, and I'm
          pretty convinced the material thickness won't matter. So I'll start
          with science fair trifold and work up from there.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Fine then, let's print.</strong>
          Started with the small hunk of trifold cadboard, normal epilog settings,
          speed 25%. Nope, way too small. Good thing we did a practice run with
          red dot and the epilog open. Swap with the larger cardboard (had to
          trim it down to 32 inches) Laser head moved unusually slow, but it worked.

          flaps are off the table, but some CNC parts are a possiblity for
          moving alierons and elevator. Also found an opportunity to use
          OneShape to cut some holes for mounting a propller bracket. Okay,

          Time for a prop-clearance study. Reach into the HobbyTown Goody Bag.
          Pull out a prop and some mounting hardware. Insult a small phillips
          screwdriver by using it to punch holes into my cardoard fuselage.

        <p><strong>Rig up some Landing Gear</strong>
          Back to the HobbyTown Brab Bag, pull out some small landing gear
          wheels and the 1/16 inch hollow brass axle.  A little soft and bendy,
          but works pretty good. Pinching on either side of the wheel keeps it
          from sliding up and down the axle, but pinching to close binds up the
          wheel so it can't roll.  At least my plan will be able to taxi in circles.
          Most importantly, the Assingment 3 struts fit as expected.

        <p><strong>Ehh... 60mm looks right.</strong>
          Airplane looks good as a Taildragger if it’s 60 mm from leading edge to
          axle. This comes out to about 60 mm overall when you account for the
          extra length to accommodate the slot, the position of the landing gear
          spar, etc.  Pretty sure this will work for tricycle gear too.

      <h3> 2:49pm @ UW MILL: Fuselage/Wing Joint </h3>

      <p><strong>Now About That fuselage ...</strong>
        What I have now is <em>waayyy</em> to loosey-goosey. There's a couple
        ways to fix this.

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cut some Slots in the wing spars.</strong>
            Fuselage slots would need to be dead-center on the wing spar, and
            would be a custom width, requiring another gauge study. Requires a
            rebuild of the entire wing.
            Potentially a second rebuild when going form cardboard to acrylic.
            Requirements:
            <ul>
              <li>New fuslage</li>
              <li>Slot study</li>
              <li>New wing</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Double Fuselage with Cross-Members</strong>
            In stead of one profile, there could be two, joined by "formers"
            made of good ol' USPS cardboard.

            <figure>
              <img src ="img/hcde598-hw08-pic63-double-fuselage-idea.png" width=500>
              <figcaption>Hmm ... </figcaption>
            </figure>

            More parts to cad, but the wing doesn't need to change. It will
            solve the "fuselage flops left and right" problem, but not the
            "wing can fall off with sufficient shaking." On the plus side, a
            fuslage cross-piece of USPS cardboard woudl provide a convenient
            place to mount the nose gear.  Requirements:
            <ul>
              <li>More CADding</li>
              <li>Doesn't need another gauge</li>
              <li>Nosewheel opportunity</li>
              <li>More prop-mounting work</li>
              <li>Wing might still fall off</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>What if the Fuselage Included an Airfoil?</strong>
            This was an older idea before I thought I could get away with
            not doing it.  the fuselage would be "cheesed out" by cutting some
            lightening holes in it. Among the holes and the "non-holes" is
            another copy of the airfoil. The holes around the airfoil allow
            the struts to be slid in and assembled. Requires the same custom
            slot-width issue as the first idea. A bit of hand-sketching tells
            me the cheesing's going to be harder than I thought.

            <figure>
              <img src ="img/hcde598-hw08-pic64-cheesed-fuselage-idea.png" width=500>
              <figcaption>I don't think this one will work.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            Caries all the
            issues of Option 1, with more CADding on top of it. Prettymuch
            guaranteed that the wing won't fall out, though. Requirments:

            <ul>
              <li>More CADding, kinda complex.</li>
              <li>New fuslage</li>
              <li>Slot study</li>
              <li>New wing</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Maybe just a "hook" will do</strong>
            Right now the leading edge just sort of "hang's there."

              <figcaption>Hmm ... </figcaption>
            </figure>

            What if I alter things just a little bit, so there's a "hook?"

      <p>
        Ok. I have an idea for a simple elevator hing that will hopefully
        work. Take the airfoil I have, and use a pair of "half circles to "
        cut it.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw08-pic67-elevator-hinge-shape.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>I think I can do this.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Put a hole in the middle of the center for one of my McMaster-Carr rivets,
        and I'm set. Every elevator airfoil gets replaced withthis pair. Add a
        regular eleavator spar to the trailing edge (not leading!) To hold
        things together. Prototype in cardboard; final in CNC (hopefully.)  Ironically,
        I can probalby test on CNC <em>before</em> a slot opens up on the laser printer.
        We'll see. Meanwhile, off to the McMaster-Carr grab bag and my Caliper.
      </p>

      <p>
        Turns out I had a couple extra airfoils, so I could do some low-fi prototyping.
        Both the click-lock(left) and arrow(right) shanks work and look reasonably good.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw08-pic68-elevator-hinge-prototypes.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Decisions, decisions .. </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        All things considered, I'm favoring the arrow shank, since I believe it
        will be more forgiving in terms of hole size. Bigger holes are easier to
        measure accurately, and the click-lock shanks just look like they demand a
        perfectly-sized hole to keep from wobbling and rattling, while the arrow
        shank is meant to "squish down" if necessary. So what steps lay ahead?
        <ul>
          <li>Cut the airfoil into two pices using a pair of half-circles.</li>
          <li>Figure out hole size from some combo of McMaster Carr specs, Caliper,
            and CNC kerf data
          </li>
          <li>
            Do some initial cuts. Probably on Bantam CNC, probalby a "hole study"
            with holes of multiple diameters.
          </li>
        </ul>

        I have a hunch this will be easier in OnShape, despite my struggles earlier
        this week. Imma review my <a href = "assignment5.html">Assignment 3 Notes</a>
        Ok, the key was to
        <a href = "assignment5.html#howto-rhino-to-onshape">
          import dxf instead of Rhino.
        </a>
        I got this (I think).

      <p><strong>Rhino to DXF to OnShape</strong>
        I tried trimming in Rhino, but that function always cuts somethign I want
        it to keep. Turns out I dind't need it. I can import the dxf using the
        <em>top menu option</em> not the bottom. Extrude but 1.5 mm (just as a test)
        and I've got just what I was hoping for.

        All right, let's see if we can cut this thing with a couple half-circles.

        says to use an 0.131 inch hole size which comes to 3.3274 mm. I'll use 3.33
        because it's a pretty number. Back to OnShape, open the sketch, make a circle.

        Ny name finally came up in the queue.  Ironic, since I was almost ready
        to print elevator hinge parts. No matter, on with the fuselage.
        Got about what I expected, althought the frontmost slot for the horizontal
        stabilizer is awfully close to the leading edge of the tail.
      </p>

      <p>
        I could get away with the assembly in cardboard, but will need some
        chamfering for this to work in arcrylic. While the plan performs much
        better against the shake test, the fuselage still wobbles left and right.
      </p>

      <p><strong>So what's next for fuselage?</strong>
        The tail is straightforward. All three slots need to be redone from
        the original airfoil. The whole thing could scoot toward the rear a
        bit more. Also need more tail material in front of the forward spar
        slot.
      </p>

        The fuselage is a bit trickier. Really not sure how I'm gonna
        pull it off in acryllic. A lot of cut and try and chamfers.
        The cheesing idea is looking beter now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imma pivot back to the horizontal stablizer. I might just be able to
        sneak in a quick cut.

        Rextrude, extract extrustion faces, export to DXF. Pull that into
        Illustrator for a quick cardboard test.  Looks like I can right-click
        the OnShape Part, select Export to DXF, then pull into Illustrator.
        In this case, <strong>Scale 1: unit = 1 Millimeters</strong> works.
        Arrange multiple copies in Illusrator, using the artboard from all my
        previous USPS cuts. Rotate them 90 degrees so the direction of the
        corrugations works out better. Isolate them to their own layer.

      <p><strong>Assembly Notes.</strong>
        Lasercutting was routine and sucessful, although a couple slots seemed
        to get "double-traced" by the laser.  No biggie. The Elevator looks like
        a symmetrical teardrop but I don't think it reall is. Kinda hafta guess.

        It sucks. Need to chop off more of the elevator. After diner.

        So the elevator hinge plan basically worked. Need to fix up the way the
        spar mates to the trailing edge, then try a couple CNC cuts. Pull the
        elevator spar into OnShape and check things out. Trimmming the Elevator
        was easy -- just move the rectangle and add a cross line.

      <p>
        Couldn't get the mating surfaces to work.  Just need to hand-transform
        the parts to get them to move and just kinda be next to eachother.
        The Revolute mating between the main stabilizer and elevator worked,
        though. Go through the same old OnShape->DXF->Adobe Illstrator chain,
        Using <strong>Scale 1: unit = 1 Millimeters</strong> when Illustrator
        asks about units. Loocs better on the lasercutter bed ...

        Check <a href="assignment5.html">assignment 5 </a> for a refresher on the

          <li>Sandwich minus top layer: <strong>1.67mm</strong></li>
        </ol>

        Okay, so with this info in hand, we want to tell Bantam where the
        cuttable material is, but also make sure it cuts all the way through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Lie #1:</strong> We'll tell Bantam the material is 1.48mm
        thick instead of 1.43mm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Lie #2:</strong> We'll also say it's hovering 1.65mm instead of
        1.67mm. Together, these lies will hopefuly ensure Bantam cuts all the
        way through while still not touching the actual aluminum spoil board.
      </p>
      <p>
        Translating everthing into Bantamese:
        <ul>
          <li>Material Size(Z): <strong>1.48</strong></li>
          <li>Material Placement(Z): <strong>1.65</strong></li>
        </ul>

        Every thing else is based on honest measurements, placing the material
        with a bit of overhang, and nudging the actual pattern in x and y so the
        tool doesn't grind along the edge in some weird way.
      </p>

      <p><strong>On to the Bantam Mahcine</strong>
        First thing, make sure the real physical tool (1/32" end mill) is installed.
        Then, run <strong>Change...</strong> at the very top-right of the UI to
        induce the tool locating process.

        Crap.  It missed the holes. Also got a second slot in the leading edge
        for some reason. On the plus side, at least they cut all the way through.
        Test-fitting failed though. Slots are too narrow for the USPS cardboard.

      </figure>

      <p><strong>Allright, so what went wrong where?</strong>
        A quick scroll-up on my web page shows the holes made it into KiCAD.
        They don't show up when I toggle the Bantam <em>Holes</em> option in the
        UI. Closing time; I'll have to look at it tomorrow.
