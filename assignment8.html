        <h3>Inches or Millimeters?</h3>
        <p>
          I started by charging off in inches, mostly based of the bed sizes
          of the epilog lasers. The thought occurs my careful notch work from

          <a href = "assignment3.html#millimeters"> Assignment 3 (Airfoil Lamp) </a>

          was in millimeters.  Also I'm having scaling problems when I go from Adobe
          Illustrator into Rhino anyway. Grashopper Airfoil generator wants
          millimeters, Dremel 3D wants millimeters, Adobe Illstrato can be converted.
          Take a deep breath, go back to Illustrator, re-do my dimentions in mm.

          Configure Rhino for millimeters.  Redo the Illustrator -> Rhino
          workflow. Measure wing in Rhino; compare to AI.

          Pull up the

            Dr. Paterson's airfoil generator from assignment 3
          </a>
          , line up the airfoil from the Tomahawk plans and roll my own. Start with
          the 129mm chord length measured from the plans, and set the thicknness
          to 20/129 = 15.5% of chord.  I can actually get pretty close.

          That said, I'm gonna go a little bigger, so I have more room for ailerons
          and hopefully fowler flaps.

        </figure>

        <p>
          Bake the airfoil, move it over by the traced fuselage, line up for
          horizontal stabilizer.  Here's my next "cheat." To avoid having to cut
          v-notches to prevent the elevator and rudder from interfering, I'm
          going to just extend the chord so the elevator portion simply overhangs
          the vertical tail. If I set my rudder the right way, no interferance
          (I hope.)

        <p>
          On to the wing spars, regenerating for millimeters.  Use the
          <a href = "assignment3.html#day-07">
            spar generator from Assignment 3
          </a>
          , but first
          <strong>think about cardboard thickness.</strong>
          In Assignment 3, all the cardboard was the us postal stuff. This time,
          the airfoils will still be the USPS thin cardboard, while the spars
          will be science fair trifold or somtehing similar. So, the slots
          cut into the spar will be thin, to accmodate the airfoils.
          <em>I can use the slot thicknesses from Assignment 3.</em>
          The slots cut into the airfoils will be thick, to accmodate the thick
          spar.  I might be able to dig up the thickness from one of my early guage
          studies, but I can worry about that later.  Important thing is I can
          <em>use the Assignment 3 spar generator with its existing slot
            dimensions</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Turns out the Spar generator actually operates in inches, but it kinda
            doesn't matter.  I can prettymuch "eyeball it" to get the spar lengh
            to agree with the wing span on the original plan.
          </p>

              Hope this works.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Similarly, I can compare it to the airfoil I just made to make sure
            the spar is narrow enough.
          </p>

          <figure>

            <figcaption>
              Hmmm ... pretty thin-looking spar.

          <p>
            I gonna probalby hafta do some prelminary laser cuts pretty soon.
            But first imma thinken the spar, then just be more careful where I
            place along the airfoil profile.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bake, and move on to the elevator spar.  This one looks small enough
            that I can probalby use USPS cardboard for the spar as well as airfoils.

          An evening appointment went longer than planned, no time to CAD tonight.
          All I can do is plan for tomorrow and the weekend.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Use an even number of airfoils, not odd.</strong>
          I had a plan to cut some lightening holes in the fuselage, and sort of
          "carve out" airfoil shapes to match the wing and horizontal stablizer.
          Forget that. Use an <em>even number</em> of airfoils, then shape the
          fuselage with an "airfoil-shaped dent" with notches for the spars to
          slide in.  Notches should only be on the fuselage side, so the wing can
          slide left and right as necessary for centering.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Friday's for Cadding Cardboard</strong>
          Ignore <em>all</em> the moving control surfaces.  First get "fixed"
          wing and stablizer done.  Do some slot-test studies for
          cardboard-to-arcryllic. Do slot & hole studies with FR-1.

            <h3>7:19 PM First Thing, Let's CAD That Stabilizer</h3>
            <p>
              It's a simple little wing, all made with USPS cardboard.  Should
              go quick, so let's get on with it. First-ofr, redo the spar because
              (a) I lost my save from last time and (b) I need to re do it for an
              even number of airfoils anyway.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Can I do the Extrusion in OnShape?</strong>
              Wonder if I can export the 2d curves as their own 3dm's for OnShape,
              rather than extrude and cap in Rhino like last time.
            </p>

            <figure>

              <figcaption>OMG It Worked!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              Actually, yes!  I'm gonna do it again though, this time moving it to
              origin in Rhino first, and naming it stabilizer-horiz-airfoil so
              my names will sort nicely when I add a spar, and when I deal with
              vertical vs. horizontal stabilizers.
            </p>

              <figcaption>Perfection.</figcaption>
            </figure>


            <p>
              So it looks like extruding in Rhino is easier after all. A 2D import
              into OnShape leaves me with a plain curve that I can't turn into a sketch or
              do anything useful with.  Extruded Rhino files come in as actual Parts
              which can be dimensioned.  Dimensions seem to check out. I just need to
              convert 0.138 inches
              (<a href = "assignment3.html#machine-settings">"Notch Size" from Assignment 3</a>)
              to 3.482 mm.
            </p>

              <figcaption>More perfecter.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              Okay, <em>now</em> move the spar over to origin in Rhino, extrude by
              3.482 mm, and import into OnShape. Now let's see if I can cut
              notches in OnShape instead of Rhino.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Or, Maybe Not.</strong> I can't find anything that will
              "cut" one 3d shape from another.  Back to Rhino.  Use my spar
              generator to bake an "airfiol slot." Line them up at varous ponints
              along the stabilizer airfoil curve. No trims, no cuts, nothing fancy.
              Just let the lasercutter do that part. Export to ai format,
              1mm = 1mm.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looks like the scaling held together.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
              Copy, paste move a few times so I have multiple spars and airfoils.
              Need to group the slots with the airfoil (feels lame, I should probaby
              trim in Rhino like an adult).  Bunch everything up tight in one corner
              to conserve cardboard. Just doing a test-fit at this point.
            </p>

            <p>
              Turned out okay.  That's reassuring.

            </figure>

            <p>
              I'm starting to re-think my chord length, though. These airfoils
              don't fit cleantly on stndard FR1.
            </p>

            <figure>

              <figcaption>Maybe smaller?</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              Sure, I could get <em>one</em> airfoil out of FR-1 if I lay it
              diagonally, but I could get 2 or three if I just shorten it a
              smidge. On the other hand, I have 20 FR1's with plenty more unused
              on the "share shelf."  So I'll move on to other issues and consider
              shortening the airfoils later.

          <div id="day-03-10:34pm-wing">
            <h3>10:34pm On to the Main Wing</h3>
            <p>
              First decision is whether to use science fair trifold or some new
              cardboard I got form an ultrawide PC monitor. At frist I was temped
              to stick with the trifold since I had used in my gauge studies from
              <a href ="assingment2.htm.">Assingment 2</a>, but I didn't really record
              what thickness actually worked (shame on me!).  Also, the PC monitor
              box cardboard is so much stiffer, I can't really turn it down. It's
              caliper and gauge-making time.
            </p>


            <p>
              <strong>Slot thicknesses and Unit Wierdness</strong>
              Okay, let's think this through. I'm <em>trying</em> to go pure
              milimeters, but I already kinda cheated with the horizontal stabilizer
              since it the slot widths were already dialed in for USPS cardboard
              and it was using inches. Now I'm about to make a wing <em>spar</em> that's
              much thicker than the USPS cardboard, while the wing <em>airfoils</em>
              are still USPS cardboard. So the <em>thick spar</em> will have
              <em>thin slots</em> cut into it for accomodating <em>thin airfoils,</em>
              while the <em>thin airfoils</em> will have <em>thick slots</em> cut into
              them for accomdating the <em>thick spar</em>.
            </p>


            <p>
              <strong>And Another Thing</strong>
              <em>All slots</em> whether for airfoil or spar, come form the
              my Grashopper spar generator, which operates in inches. So the
              path of least resistance is ...
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Set the caliper for inches, measure cardoard.</li>
              <li>Use my older inches-based guage generator.</li>
              <li>Use the existing inches-based spar generator.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              While the path to righteousness would entail ...
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Set the caliper for inches, measure cardoard.</li>
              <li>Use my newer metric guage generator.</li>
              <li>Modify the spar generator to take metric inputs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I have plenty of other things to modify. Gonna stay on the dark
              side and set the caliper for inches.
            </p>


            <p>
              <strong>So many thicknesses to choose from.</strong>
              Turns out different parts of that monitor box are different
              thicknesses. The biggest piece is 0.1570 inches to 0.1805, depending
              on where you measure and whether you take a "deep bite" with the
              calipers or only "nibble" with the tips. So given that my gauge
              generator can make five slots.  I'm gonna set the middle
              <strong>caliper slot</strong> to <strong>0.1600</strong>, and the
              <strong>Slot size</strong> to <strong>0.0100</strong> that should
              give me slots of
              <strong>0.1400, 0.1500, 0.1600, 0.1700, and 0.1800.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Oops</h3>
            <p>
              The actual slot thickness is 0.043. I messed up my earlier OnShape
              extrusions. That's why the airfoil looked so mutch thicker than its
              "spar slots"

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Elevator spar should not have slots.</strong>
                The arfoils need to slide so they can butt right up against the
                horizontal stabilizer to accept a "pin hinge."
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Plan for Wire Landing Gear Axle</strong>
                Ideally the wire thickness would match the USPS cardbaord, so I
                can re-use the 3d printed slot from assingment 3.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maybe forzen lolipop landing gear.</strong>
                Could take the T-sticks from Assingment 3 and replace the T
                with a disk.  Boom! Easy but lame landing gear.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maybe prop shaft</strong>
                This would be 3d-printed, and look kind of like a giant
                arrow-shaped push rivet.  Will probably require multiple prints
                and tests, though.
