      <p>
        Haven't done a deep-read of the final project requirements yet, but I
        have some basic ideas.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>It's gonna be an airplane. </strong> Probalby a static model,
            not flying. Some airplanes are literally flying wings:
            <figure>
              <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Northrop_N-1M_Udvar-Hazy.jpg#/media/File:Northrop_N-1M_Udvar-Hazy.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Northrop_N-1M_Udvar-Hazy.jpg" alt="Northrop N-1M Udvar-Hazy.jpg" height="371" width="640"></a><br>By No machine-readable author provided. <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Demilio~commonswiki&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Demilio~commonswiki (page does not exist)">Demilio~commonswiki</a> assumed (based on copyright claims). - No machine-readable source provided.

            </figure>

          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Lots of laser cutting. </strong> Really emphasize the wing
            framework. All the spars and airfoils I'm good at, but more intricate.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Some amount of stock parts. </strong> Probalby 3d print or maybe
            mill engine cowls, canopies, propellers as necessary. Maybe wheels from
            an hoppy shop; maybe a model with "retracted" landing gear.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>What if the whole model came from thingiverse?</strong> That's
            how I'd do a scale model. But instead of 3d printing, I'd "slice" it
            and do a bunch of lasercutting.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <p>Asked Nadya a question about stock parts.</p>
      <p><em>Can I base everything off a thingiverse model?</em></p>
      <p>
        Yes, as long as I show some creativity in how I manufacture.  Don't just
        3D print it.
      </p>

      <p>Asked Joshua some questions:</p>
      <p>
        <em>
          I'll probably incorporate my fowler flap, but it's gonna be really small.
          what kind of stock parts/fittings can I use in place of the rivets?
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, <a href "https://www.mcmaster.com/push-rivets">
          McMaster Carr has push rivets down to 0.063 inches.
        </a>
        should be able to scale down my
        <a href ="assignment4.html"> Homework 4 Fowler Flap</a> linkage to itsy-bitsy,
        and use Bantam/FR1 instead of lasercutter/acrylic.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          I want to "cheese" my airfoils -- cut out a bunch of triangular holes so
          it looks like a truss instead of a solid piece (below). Does Rhino or
          OnShape have functions to do this automaticaly?
        </em>

        <figure>
          <img src ="https://jameswiebe.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/b9b2f-belitewingconstruction.jpg" width=800>
          <figcaption>James Wiebe talks airplanes and stuff (WordPress)</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
      <p>Joshua didn't think they did.</p>
      <p>
        <em>
          I saw a tool in Rhino, that looks like it can automaicaly cut slots for
          the kind of airfoil-meets-spar joints I like to do. Do you know about those?
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        He doesn't, and after checking Rhino and Grashopper and OnShape, I can't
        find the tool either.  I no longer believe it exists.
      </p>


      <p>
        Before I sign off and git-commit/push for the day, Imma scan the actual
        project requirements real-quick.  The only real constraing is to use
        at least four techniques.
        <ol>
          <li><strong>lasercutting</strong> wing and other framing structures/</li>
          <li><strong>3d printing</strong> cowl/nose cone</li>
          <li><strong>casting</strong> canopy.</li>
          <li><strong>mechanism</strong> flaps and/or other control surfaces</li>
        </ol>

        That should do it.

        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Fluke Woodshop Training & Staff Discussions.</h3>
      <p>
        Fluke is almost a no go. No weekend hours this quarter (well, they're open
        Sundays but no staff to help or supervise.). They close at eight. I could
        maybe cram in a two hour print shop after work, practically need PTO and
        show up at 2pm to do anything useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>CNC ShopBot: </strong>
        No training available this quarter so ShopBot is a no go.
        The other CNC is are a possibility if I have your tool pathing set.
        Even then, would have to do it with a staffer which means it has to be a
        weekday evening. Available CNC's:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ShobBot:</strong> Unable to train for this one.</li>
          <li><strong>Tormach PCNC 440</strong>Might be able to use this under supervision.</li>
          <li><strong>Roland</strong>Can't figure out what model of Roland this is.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Laser cutters:</strong>
        <ul>
          Red Universal laser systems:24 x 48 inches Yellow universal laser systems
          45x60 cm Practically half the size of the ones at the Mill.
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q&A with Fluke Staff</strong>
        Confirmed I can start long-term/overnight print jobs and pick them up
        the next day. If I use fluke at all, it will probably be for bigger and more reliable
        3-D printers, as well as the vacuum former.
      </p>

      <h3>MILL Visit</h3>
      <p>
        Reconfirm dimensions of my cardboard
        <ul>
          <li>Trifold is 36 inches.</li>
          <li>Monitor box is about 40 inches.</li>
          <li>Priority mail is 20 1/2, with middle part at 14 inches.</li>
        </ul>

        Also checked availability of vacuum forming -- nope.
      </p>

      <h3>OKay, So ...</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Biggest wingpan & fuselage length I can make is about 39 inches.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wing chord (based on prioirty mail cardboard) is around 14 inches.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'll probably still use the MILL for most stuff, but Fluke for
            vacuum forming and perhapse 3D printing.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <h3>Other Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        I just-might make a flying model after all, ruberband-powered.  I could
        do a basic plane with mulitple wings, based on multiple NACA airfoils,
        that you could interchange. That would (what feels like) a stronger
        intended use than "static model to look at" or at best "teaching tool to
        explore aicraft internals and how control surfaces move."  I'll probably
        give that some more thought another day.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4:34 pm All Right, Let's Get this Session Stared</h3>
        <p>
          Okay, imma start by googling up some images for the cover slide.
          Probalby do a "collage" with a basic aircraft, plus callouts for
          cardboard lasercutting, 3d printing, etc.  I'm zeroing in on a
          Piper Tomahawk as my aircraft of choice, because ..
          <ul>
            <li>Simple rectangular "heshey bar" wing</li>
            <li>Wing on bottom/tail on top for easy attahcment</li>
            <li>Bubble canopy</li>
          </ul>

          I've actually beeen thinking of this aircraft for much of the quarter,
          but my learnings since then have made me more confident in my original
          choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's an interesting hit. Plans for an old-school balsa model, but
          with lots of cross-section info on wings, tail, fueslage that I could
          use.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Potential cross-ection material.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>5:33 PM</strong> I'm pretty happy with the overall concept,
          materials, etc on my slide 1, now I'm starting to think about timelines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imma use
          <a href ="https://github.com/LeoSalemann/LeoSalemann.github.io/issues">
            github issues
          </a>
          and
          <a href ="https://github.com/LeoSalemann/LeoSalemann.github.io/milestones">
            github milestones
          </a>
          to lay out my timeline.  Started with the
          <a href ="https://github.com/LeoSalemann/LeoSalemann.github.io/milestone/1">
            Order Parts
          </a>
          milestone since that's one of the the first things that needs to
          happen; now imma pivot to "working backwards" by laying out the
          last milestone and figuring out what needs to happen before that; then
          keep working up the chain.
        </p>

        <h3>Managing Nights and Weekends</h3>
        <p>
          Okay, laying out
          <a href ="https://github.com/LeoSalemann/LeoSalemann.github.io/milestones">
            github milestones
          </a>

          Has been very illuminating. Dates are starting to "crash into each other"
          as I think about how much time I need to set asside for 3D printing vs.
          laser cutting vs. CNC -- not to say how many "pure cadding" days I'll need.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few major things are starting to jump out:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>There's only one left in the schedule. </strong>
              By the time I get to Saturday June 1 all the CAD, lasercutting,
              and cardboard assembly needs to be complete. I'm going to need
              <em>all</em> the weekend time for lon-lead fab jobs like vacuum
              forming and 3d printing.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>I need as few unknowns as possible. </strong>
              This means sticking with the materials I know - science fair
              trifolds and USPS cardbaords, so I don't need to do further
              thickness studies.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Along similar lines, I need to work up some contingency plans.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Forget the Flaps </strong> and go with simple hinges
              for ailerons, elevator, and rudder.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Screw It and Glue It </strong> instead of
              <em>Clueless and Glueless</em>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Flat Fueselage</strong> Less cadding and faster
              laser cutting, though I'd need to rethink my 3D printing and
              vacuum forming.  Maybe save that for wing tips.
            </li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>7:49 pm Getting Back to Taming the Schedule</h3>

        <p>
          Okay, in the pre-dinner session I figured out there's only one full
          Saturday and Sunday avaialble for this project, and that I need to have
          all the CAD ready so I can spend those day days on long-lead Fabrication
          tasks. I've also got some contingencies identified.  Now I feel like
          pivoting and doing "contingencies" first. In other words, an agile-style
          iterative plan.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Get the Inevitable Stuff Out fo the Way First. </strong>
              No matter what contingencies I take, there will definetly be wings,
              horizontal stablizer (the small wing-like thing in the back), and
              hinges for ailerons and elevator.  If those hinges involve push
              rivets and some CNC/FR1 parts, we've got <strong>Lasercutting,
                CNC, and mechanisim design</strong> done already. If I go with
                Grashopper, for the airfoils, I have <strong>parameteric design</strong> too.
                That's <strong>four fabrication techniques(ish)</strong> already.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flat Fuselage Before Full. </strong>
              Have a flat fueslage ready for lastercutting before doing anything
              with 3D cowls or vacuum formed canopies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Slide in the Sliding Fowler Flaps. </strong>
              Adds lots of coolness, re-uses lots of what I did in the past.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3D Print Some Airfoil Tips. </strong>Easy way to bag one
              more fabrication technique. Can use them whether I go flat fuselage
              or full 3D.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Square Away Those Stock Parts. </strong>
              Wheel's, prop, spinner -- makes the model look finished no
              matter what.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Finally a Full Fuselage. </strong>
              If I make it this far and there's still time left, I can CAD and
              lasercut framing for a full 3D fuselage. Hand-in-hand with that
              would (probably) come a 3D-printed cowl and vacuum formed canopy.
              So if all that's actually gonna happen, and I need the weekend for
              those long-lead items, I'd need to be CAD-complete on this by Friday.

          Let's tansfer this sthese ideas into my "Schedule" slide.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>9:36 pm </strong> Feeling pretty good about my slides, I think
          I've met the minbar for the assingment. Tomorrow I'll sunch up my

          </a>
          and get to work with some parts procurement and initial cadding.
