      <p>
        Haven't done a deep-read of the final project requirements yet, but I
        have some basic ideas.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>It's gonna be an airplane. </strong> Probalby a static model,
            not flying. Some airplanes are literally flying wings:
            <figure>
              <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Northrop_N-1M_Udvar-Hazy.jpg#/media/File:Northrop_N-1M_Udvar-Hazy.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Northrop_N-1M_Udvar-Hazy.jpg" alt="Northrop N-1M Udvar-Hazy.jpg" height="371" width="640"></a><br>By No machine-readable author provided. <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Demilio~commonswiki&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Demilio~commonswiki (page does not exist)">Demilio~commonswiki</a> assumed (based on copyright claims). - No machine-readable source provided.

            </figure>

          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Lots of laser cutting. </strong> Really emphasize the wing
            framework. All the spars and airfoils I'm good at, but more intricate.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Some amount of stock parts. </strong> Probalby 3d print or maybe
            mill engine cowls, canopies, propellers as necessary. Maybe wheels from
            an hoppy shop; maybe a model with "retracted" landing gear.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>What if the whole model came from thingiverse?</strong> That's
            how I'd do a scale model. But instead of 3d printing, I'd "slice" it
            and do a bunch of lasercutting.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <p>Asked Nadya a question about stock parts.</p>
      <p><em>Can I base everything off a thingiverse model?</em></p>
      <p>
        Yes, as long as I show some creativity in how I manufacture.  Don't just
        3D print it.
      </p>

      <p>Asked Joshua some questions:</p>
      <p>
        <em>
          I'll probably incorporate my fowler flap, but it's gonna be really small.
          what kind of stock parts/fittings can I use in place of the rivets?
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, <a href "https://www.mcmaster.com/push-rivets">
          McMaster Carr has push rivets down to 0.063 inches.
        </a>
        should be able to scale down my
        <a href ="assignment4.html"> Homework 4 Fowler Flap</a> linkage to itsy-bitsy,
        and use Bantam/FR1 instead of lasercutter/acrylic.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          I want to "cheese" my airfoils -- cut out a bunch of triangular holes so
          it looks like a truss instead of a solid piece (below). Does Rhino or
          OnShape have functions to do this automaticaly?
        </em>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>James Wiebe talks airplanes and stuff (WordPress)</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
      <p>Joshua didn't think they did.</p>
      <p>
        <em>
          I saw a tool in Rhino, that looks like it can automaicaly cut slots for
          the kind of airfoil-meets-spar joints I like to do. Do you know about those?
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        He doesn't, and after checking Rhino and Grashopper and OnShape, I can't
        find the tool either.  I no longer believe it exists.
      </p>


      <p>
        Before I sign off and git-commit/push for the day, Imma scan the actual
        project requirements real-quick.  The only real constraing is to use
        at least four techniques.
        <ol>
          <li><strong>lasercutting</strong> wing and other framing structures/</li>
          <li><strong>3d printing</strong> cowl/nose cone</li>
          <li><strong>casting</strong> canopy.</li>
          <li><strong>mechanism</strong> flaps and/or other control surfaces</li>
        </ol>

        That should do it.

        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Fluke Woodshop Training & Staff Discussions.</h3>
      <p>
        Fluke is almost a no go. No weekend hours this quarter (well, they're open
        Sundays but no staff to help or supervise.). They close at eight. I could
        maybe cram in a two hour print shop after work, practically need PTO and
        show up at 2pm to do anything useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>CNC ShopBot: </strong>
        No training available this quarter so ShopBot is a no go.
        The other CNC is are a possibility if I have your tool pathing set.
        Even then, would have to do it with a staffer which means it has to be a
        weekday evening. Available CNC's:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ShobBot:</strong> Unable to train for this one.</li>
          <li><strong>Tormach PCNC 440</strong>Might be able to use this under supervision.</li>
          <li><strong>Roland</strong>Can't figure out what model of Roland this is.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Laser cutters:</strong>
        <ul>
          Red Universal laser systems:24 x 48 inches Yellow universal laser systems
          45x60 cm Practically half the size of the ones at the Mill.
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q&A with Fluke Staff</strong>
        Confirmed I can start long-term/overnight print jobs and pick them up
        the next day. If I use fluke at all, it will probably be for bigger and more reliable
        3-D printers, as well as the vacuum former.
      </p>

      <h3>Other Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        I just-might make a flying model after all, ruberband-powered.  I could
        do a basic plane with mulitple wings, based on multiple NACA airfoils,
        that you could interchange. That would (what feels like) a stronger
        intended use than "static model to look at" or at best "teaching tool to
        explore aicraft internals and how control surfaces move."  I'll probably
        give that some more thought another day.
