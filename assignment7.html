            <strong>It's gonna be an airplane. </strong> Probalby a static model,
            not flying. Some airplanes are literally flying wings:

          <li>
            <strong>Lots of laser cutting. </strong> Really emphasize the wing
            framework. All the spars and airfoils I'm good at, but more intricate.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Some amount of stock parts. </strong> Probalby 3d print or maybe
            mill engine cowls, canopies, propellers as necessary. Maybe wheels from
            an hoppy shop; maybe a model with "retracted" landing gear.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>What if the whole model came from thingiverse?</strong> That's
            how I'd do a scale model. But instead of 3d printing, I'd "slice" it
            and do a bunch of lasercutting.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <p>Asked Nadya a question about stock parts.</p>
      <p><em>Can I base everything off a thingiverse model?</em></p>
      <p>
        Yes, as long as I show some creativity in how I manufacture.  Don't just
        3D print it.
      </p>

      <p>Asked Joshua some questions:</p>
      <p>
        <em>
          I'll probably incorporate my fowler flap, but it's gonna be really small.
          what kind of stock parts/fittings can I use in place of the rivets?
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes,
        <a href ="https://www.mcmaster.com/push-rivets">
          McMaster Carr has push rivets down to 0.063 inches.
        </a>
        should be able to scale down my
        <a href ="assignment4.html"> Homework 4 Fowler Flap</a> linkage to itsy-bitsy,
        and use Bantam/FR1 instead of lasercutter/acrylic.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          I want to "cheese" my airfoils -- cut out a bunch of triangular holes so
          it looks like a truss instead of a solid piece (below). Does Rhino or
          OnShape have functions to do this automaticaly?
        </em>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>James Wiebe talks airplanes and stuff (WordPress)</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
      <p>Joshua didn't think they did.</p>
      <p>
        <em>
          I saw a tool in Rhino, that looks like it can automaicaly cut slots for
          the kind of airfoil-meets-spar joints I like to do. Do you know about those?
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        He doesn't, and after checking Rhino and Grashopper and OnShape, I can't
        find the tool either.  I no longer believe it exists.
      </p>


      <p>
        Before I sign off and git-commit/push for the day, Imma scan the actual
        project requirements real-quick.  The only real constraing is to use
        at least four techniques.
        <ol>
          <li><strong>lasercutting</strong> wing and other framing structures/</li>
          <li><strong>3d printing</strong> cowl/nose cone</li>
          <li><strong>casting</strong> canopy.</li>
          <li><strong>mechanism</strong> flaps and/or other control surfaces</li>
        </ol>

        That should do it.

        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Fluke Woodshop Training & Staff Discussions.</h3>
      <p>
        Fluke is almost a no go. No weekend hours this quarter (well, they're open
        Sundays but no staff to help or supervise.). They close at eight. I could
        maybe cram in a two hour print shop after work, practically need PTO and
        show up at 2pm to do anything useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>CNC ShopBot: </strong>
        No training available this quarter so ShopBot is a no go.
        The other CNC is are a possibility if I have your tool pathing set.
        Even then, would have to do it with a staffer which means it has to be a
        weekday evening. Available CNC's:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ShobBot:</strong> Unable to train for this one.</li>
          <li><strong>Tormach PCNC 440</strong>Might be able to use this under supervision.</li>
          <li><strong>Roland</strong>Can't figure out what model of Roland this is.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Laser cutters:</strong>
        <ul>
          Red Universal laser systems:24 x 48 inches Yellow universal laser systems
          45x60 cm Practically half the size of the ones at the Mill.
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q&A with Fluke Staff</strong>
        Confirmed I can start long-term/overnight print jobs and pick them up
        the next day. If I use fluke at all, it will probably be for bigger and more reliable
        3-D printers, as well as the vacuum former.
      </p>

      <h3>MILL Visit</h3>
      <p>
        Reconfirm dimensions of my cardboard
        <ul>
          <li>Trifold is 36 inches.</li>
          <li>Monitor box is about 40 inches.</li>
          <li>Priority mail is 20 1/2, with middle part at 14 inches.</li>
        </ul>

        Also checked availability of vacuum forming -- nope.
      </p>

      <h3>Okay, So ...</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Biggest wingpan & fuselage length I can make is about 39 inches.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wing chord (based on prioirty mail cardboard) is around 14 inches.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'll probably still use the MILL for most stuff, but Fluke for
            vacuum forming and perhapse 3D printing.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <h3>Other Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        I just-might make a flying model after all, ruberband-powered.  I could
        do a basic plane with mulitple wings, based on multiple NACA airfoils,
        that you could interchange. That would (what feels like) a stronger
        intended use than "static model to look at" or at best "teaching tool to
        explore aicraft internals and how control surfaces move."  I'll probably
        give that some more thought another day.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4:34 pm All Right, Let's Get this Session Started</h3>
        <p>
          Okay, imma start by googling up some images for the cover slide.
          Probalby do a "collage" with a basic aircraft, plus callouts for
          cardboard lasercutting, 3d printing, etc.  I'm zeroing in on a
          Piper Tomahawk as my aircraft of choice, because ..
          <ul>
            <li>Simple rectangular "heshey bar" wing</li>
            <li>Wing on bottom/tail on top for easy attahcment</li>
            <li>Bubble canopy</li>
          </ul>

          I've actually beeen thinking of this aircraft for much of the quarter,
          but my learnings since then have made me more confident in my original
          choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's an interesting hit. Plans for an old-school balsa model, but
          with lots of cross-section info on wings, tail, fueslage that I could
          use.
        </p>

          <img src ="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/c4/a9/15c4a9bf9a8bdc42b91db6974e7306c4.jpg" width=1024>
          <figcaption>Potential cross-ection material.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>5:33 PM</strong> I'm pretty happy with the overall concept,
          materials, etc on my slide 1, now I'm starting to think about timelines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imma use
          <a href ="https://github.com/LeoSalemann/LeoSalemann.github.io/issues">
            github issues
          </a>
          and
          <a href ="https://github.com/LeoSalemann/LeoSalemann.github.io/milestones">
            github milestones
          </a>
          to lay out my timeline.  Started with the
          <a href ="https://github.com/LeoSalemann/LeoSalemann.github.io/milestone/1">
            Order Parts
          </a>
          milestone since that's one of the the first things that needs to
          happen; now imma pivot to "working backwards" by laying out the
          last milestone and figuring out what needs to happen before that; then
          keep working up the chain.
        </p>

        <h3>Managing Nights and Weekends</h3>
        <p>
          Okay, laying out
          <a href ="https://github.com/LeoSalemann/LeoSalemann.github.io/milestones">
            github milestones
          </a>

          Has been very illuminating. Dates are starting to "crash into each other"
          as I think about how much time I need to set asside for 3D printing vs.
          laser cutting vs. CNC -- not to say how many "pure cadding" days I'll need.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few major things are starting to jump out:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>There's only one left in the schedule. </strong>
              By the time I get to Saturday June 1 all the CAD, lasercutting,
              and cardboard assembly needs to be complete. I'm going to need
              <em>all</em> the weekend time for lon-lead fab jobs like vacuum
              forming and 3d printing.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>I need as few unknowns as possible. </strong>
              This means sticking with the materials I know - science fair
              trifolds and USPS cardbaords, so I don't need to do further
              thickness studies.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Along similar lines, I need to work up some contingency plans.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Forget the Flaps </strong> and go with simple hinges
              for ailerons, elevator, and rudder.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Screw It and Glue It </strong> instead of
              <em>Clueless and Glueless</em>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Flat Fueselage</strong> Less cadding and faster
              laser cutting, though I'd need to rethink my 3D printing and
              vacuum forming.  Maybe save that for wing tips.
            </li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>7:49 pm Getting Back to Taming the Schedule</h3>

          Okay, in the pre-dinner session I figured out there's only one full
          Saturday and Sunday avaialble for this project, and that I need to have
          all the CAD ready so I can spend those day days on long-lead Fabrication
          tasks. I've also got some contingencies identified.  Now I feel like
          pivoting and doing "contingencies" first. In other words, an agile-style
          iterative plan.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Get the Inevitable Stuff Out fo the Way First. </strong>
            No matter what contingencies I take, there will definetly be wings,
            horizontal stablizer (the small wing-like thing in the back), and
            hinges for ailerons and elevator.  If those hinges involve push
            rivets and some CNC/FR1 parts, we've got <strong>Lasercutting,
              CNC, and mechanisim design</strong> done already. If I go with
              Grashopper, for the airfoils, I have <strong>parameteric design</strong> too.
              That's <strong>four fabrication techniques(ish)</strong> already.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flat Fuselage Before Full. </strong>
              Have a flat fueslage ready for lastercutting before doing anything
              with 3D cowls or vacuum formed canopies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Slide in the Sliding Fowler Flaps. </strong>
              Adds lots of coolness, re-uses lots of what I did in the past.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3D Print Some Airfoil Tips. </strong>Easy way to bag one
              more fabrication technique. Can use them whether I go flat fuselage
              or full 3D.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Square Away Those Stock Parts. </strong>
              Wheel's, prop, spinner -- makes the model look finished no
              matter what.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Finally a Full Fuselage. </strong>
              If I make it this far and there's still time left, I can CAD and
              lasercut framing for a full 3D fuselage. Hand-in-hand with that
              would (probably) come a 3D-printed cowl and vacuum formed canopy.
              So if all that's actually gonna happen, and I need the weekend for
              those long-lead items, I'd need to be CAD-complete on this by Friday.
            </li>
          </ol>

          Let's tansfer this sthese ideas into my "Schedule" slide.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>9:36 pm </strong> Feeling pretty good about my slides, I think
          I've met the minbar for the assingment. Tomorrow I'll sunch up my

            was pretty straightforward. The sheer number of tasks is making
            me want to trim my project concept even more ... maybe pivot
            back to that flying wing concept.
          </p>

          <p>
            Checking Amazon & McMaster-Carr proves
            that I need to order parts today if I want to have them on time.
            The FR-1's a no-brainer, but it's hard to even guess at the
            right pins until I do some initial cadding.

          <p>
            I have a pretty good handle on what's involved with the Piper
            Tomahawk concept - start with 3D wings and flat fuselage, move
            on to 3D fuselage if time allows.  What would a Northrop N-1M
            involve?

          <p>
            Looks feasible, could very well be easier than the Tomahawk.
            Seems to hit all the features I'm looking to do, with fewer parts
            to manufacture. I could either "trace" the pdf plans, or do a
            parametric approximation by modifying my wing spar generator to
            support the angled slots required by the swept leading edge. Then
            I'd use the Grashopper airfoil generator to approsimate the various
            airfiols form the plans. So what's thing going to entail?
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Spars for Swept Wings.</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Start with the homework 3 parametric wings spar, set the
                  slots at an angle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Figure out a way to fuse two spars to make a V.
                </li>
                <li> Use science fair trifoil cardboard.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Airfoils</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Start with the pdf plan, pull in one airfoil into
                  Rhino as a reference image.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use the Grashopper airfoil generator to generate foils
                  that more-or-less match.
                </li>
                <li>Use USPS cardboard.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Control surfaces</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Trailing edge is straight (thank goodness) so it's no
                  different than what I have planned for the Tomahawk.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I don't think N-1M had actual fowler flaps, but I could
                  do them "just for show."
                </li>
                <li>
                  Also an opportunity for "split flaps" used in flying
                  wings.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Landing Gear</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Start with the 3D prints from assingment 3, since
                  we're using the same USPS cardboard.
                </li>
                <li>Re-use the slot, but combine with something that can
                  accomodate wire landing gear avaialble at hobby shops.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Propeller Farings</strong>
              The props can be stock parts; the yellow fairings that
              support them could be tricky.
              <ul>
                <li>Use specialized airfoils for the basic shape</li>
                <li>
                  Lay a 3d-printed "adaptor" on the top that has an
                  assingment 3 style groove for the airofil side and a
                  round hole on the other side for attaching the prop.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stock Parts</strong>
              If I'm gonna do this, I should by props & landing gear
              asap so I can work out how I'm gona do 3D printed adaptors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Canopy</strong>
              <em>Reallly</em> hope I can reuse one from assingment 6.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So I think the flying wing might be easier, but I'm not ready
            to refactor my project plan just yet. Probably noodle with some
            swept wing desings and scanned planns, thoug.
          </p>

          <h3>1:41pm-2:37pm Playing With Plans</h3>
          <p>
            One of the big unknowns is how the interplay between the pdf plans
            that cad tootls is gonna work.  So let's try that.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Download the Plans.</strong>
              Came as JPG, so far, so good.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Isolate an Airofil.</strong>
              Open in Paint.net (Right-click/Edit in Win10), select an airfoil
              from the overall plans, copy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add to Illustrator</strong>
              Paste the Airfoil into Adobe Illustrator, Resize the arboard
              to be just-big enough for the foil, rather than the entire
              32x22 inch lasercutter bed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vectorize in Illustrator</strong>
              Select the aifriol, then Object Menu > Image Trace > Expand.
              Export as DXF
            </li>

            <li><strong>Pull into Rhino</strong>
              Pull the DXF into Rhino, align so it faces same direciton
              as Grashopper Airfoil generator.  Generate a foil, try to get
              it to match.
            </li>

            Still need to order those parts.  Before I can know (roughly)
            what size pins I to order, I need an idea of how big this thing
            is gonna be. The original plans are "chopped" such that they
            don't show the full wingspan.

            Now I can take some mesurments from illutrator. By just drawing
            a ling along certain features and reading off itss length.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Half spar lengh of <strong>439 mm</strong></li>
            <li>Max Airfoil chord length of <strong>235 mm</strong></li>
            <li>Midway Airfoil chord length of <strong>154 mm</strong></li>
            <li>Small Airfoil chord length of <strong>90 mm</strong></li>
            <li>Tip Airfoil chord length of <strong>45 mm</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Next, I'll grab that airfoil I made earlier, set the chord length
            to 154 mm, import into OnShape, and see if I can scale my fowler flap mechansim from
            Assingment 4 to fit. Nice, OnShape interpreted my 154 mm airofil as
            8037mm.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wait.  I'm overthinking this big-time. I can just go to adobe
            Illustrator and measure there. Duh.  Zoom in on the plan in
            Illustrator.  Aileron lies between Airfoils 6 and 10, with 10
            beign the smallest.

            Find Airfoil 10 aond the plan, zoom and measure. Draw a box
            representing a pin, get 0.08 inches. That's the max hole size.
            The airfoil is about 0.17 inches thick at this spot, so that's
            the max head diameter.

            Going through my notes from Assingment 3, my calipers said the
            USPS cardboard was 0.08in thick. In Assingment 5, my FR-1 was
            1.65mm which comes to 0.06496063 inches.  In Assingment 4, I made a
            fowler flap linkage with no more than two layers per pin.
            So I'm looking for:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li> Head diameter of 0.17 in. </li>
            <li> Hole size of 0.08 inches or less.</li>
            <li> Material thickness of 0.145 inches. </li>
          </ul>

            All right, I've got my masurements (finally) now I can hit

              McMaster-Carr
            </a>
            and see how close I can get. Looking over the filtering choices,
            it's going to be all about hole size, with material thickness a
            second priority and head diamter third. Dialing in the filters on the
            left-hand pane. Filtering for ...
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hole Size 0.064 - 0.094</li>
            <li>Material Thicness up to 0.249</li>
            <li>Head dimater 0.1 ro 0.2 </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It's also worth noting that the most senstive measurment is
            material thickness. If I need a larger hole or head size, I can just
            slide the hole further forward where the airfoil is always thicker.
            If the rivet wants a thicker material, I can shim it with thin
            washers or something. Not much I can do if I exceed the rivets max
            material thickness though.

            Factoring them all together I get ...

            Am I <em>really</em> going to use cardboard airfoils with my moving
            parts? They performed so poorly in the cardboard prototype stage of
            assingment 4. If an Airfoil's going to have a rivet in it, it should
            be made of arcryllic. If it's arcryllic, it should be the same
            thickness I used in assungment 4, since the thinner stuff breaks
            easily. Gonna need to recalculate my material thickness again.

          <h3>7:48pm-7:56pm; 8:49pm-9:44pm Recalibrating for Arcryillic Airfoils </h3>

          <p>
            My prior McMaster-Carr shopping assumed I'd be fastening FR-1 linkages
            to USPS cardboard. I should really use 1/8" arcryillic for airfoils
            that will have rivets in them, or maybe FR1 for them too. All the
            airfoils that aren't involved with moving parts can still be cardboard.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>8:49 pm What's the biggest airfoil I can make with FR-1?</strong>
            The standard size is 100 x 70mm, which yields a max chord lenth of
            about 122 mm according to Pythagoras, so trim it to
            <strong> 118 mm </strong>  to allow some  slop on the ends. Only the a
            irofils near the tips are that small, so <strong> airfoils that
            connect to flaps and ailerons will need to be arcryllic.</strong>
            The ailerons and flaps themselves? Those could be FR-1.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What will my linkages look like?</strong>
            The simple "hinge-type" linkages for ailrons, elevons and rudders
            will involve a "wing airfoil" made of 1/8 inch arcryllic connected to
            a small "control surface airfoii" mae fo FR-1 with a single pin. Fowler
            flaps would also involve a 1/8 inch arcryllic "wing airfoil" connected
            to an FR-1 "flap airfoil," but there would be multiple FR1 linkages
            in between. Pulling up one of the images from Assingment 4 ...

          <p>
            Ok, that confirms every linkage is either FR1-FR1 or FR1-Acryllic;
            no other combinations.  Now I know I'm looking for mmaterial
            thickness of <strong> 0.13 and 0.19 inches</strong> (unless and until
              yet another brain burp convinces me otherwise).

            Okay, I'm liking this. Two choices for each thickenss.  I'll be
            committed to Click-Lock shanks for Arcryllic-to-FR1 connections, but
            will have a choice between Click-Lock and Arrow for FR1-to-FR1.
            Now I'm gonna take a break, think things over then place the order if
            I'm still feeling good about it.
