        <li>Found a loophole in in Assignment, gonna make a wing again.</li>
        <li>
          Box wings are real, but my assignment isn't one of them.

        <li>
          Once again, i was able to take the in-class example, and warp it to my will.
        </li>

        <li>
          The interconnectedness of the box parts made it a little tricky to
          resize them, but it was possible. A from-sratch solustion would probably
          have been more elegant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learned to "lie a little" with material depths and z-offests to get
          the Bantam mill to actually cut all the way through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pretty happy with how my teeny tiny airfoils turned out! Pointy
          trailing edges and everything!
        </li>
        <li>
          Pretty sad with how loose my notch-n-slot joinery was.
        </li>
        <li>
          The only way to be sure you have the right tool in the mill is to
          set it yourself.

    <div id="day-01">
      <h2>DAY ONE: Get my FAQ's Straight</h2>
      <p>
        The assignment says "box" but the FAQ's say any 3d object made of
        milled parts will do. So my good ol' wing with airfoils and spars
        should do just fine.
      </p>

      <h3>Avoid Abuse With Strategic Re-Use</h3>
      <p>
        I've got my Grashopper scripts for generating airfoils and spars. They
        can be easily scaled down to fit on the FR-1. I'll need to be less
        cavalier about cut-outs, though -- none of this extra rectangle crap.
        I'll probably use OnShape for righteous airfoil cut outs, chamfers,
        and fillets.
      </p>

      <h3>Hmmm Box Wings Are Actually a Thing</h3>

      <p>
        This is where I start to have terrible complicated ideas that I abandon
        for something that's actually achievable.  So "box" and "wing" aren't
        mutually exclusive.  They exist in concept, and I believe a few small
        examples have flown.
      </p>


      <figure>

            via Wikimedia Commons
          </a>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        But anyway, making one of these from the get-go is a terrible idea that
        would put my whole assignment at risk. So I'll get a conventional wing
        to exist first, then see if there's time left.
      </p>

      <h3> What was the Plan Again?</h3>
      <p>
        Dropping the Reality Distortion Field, an actual plan would be something
        like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Review in-class videos to make sure I know what I'm doing.</li>
        <li>Pull some wings and airfoils from Grashopper into OnShape.</li>
        <li>Build righteous tool paths in OnShape.</li>
        <li>
          Run the OnShape -> Bantam Mill workflow like a normal person for a
          change.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there's any time and material left (yeah, right) get weird and boxy
          with it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>DAY TWO: Sketch It! Sketch It Good!</h2>
      <p>
        Took a day off yesterday, got some ideas on how to reuse/repurpose the
        in-class box demo. It's all about slots and notches. I can reuse the slots
        in my airfoils, and the notches in some between-foil spars.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        I'll probalby need to do the same "notch into notch" technique I used
        in my carboard wings. The key dimension here is slot width <strong>w</strong>
        (below). If I can
        <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ASSUME%20%28ass%20u%20me%29">
          <em>assume</em>
        </a>
        that the in-class box demo will indeed product a snug-fitting box, then
        the widths of the slots should be the <strong>w</strong> I need.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw05-pic02-sketch02.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>I hope this slot width works.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        A little poking around with the OnShape file tells me
        <strong>w = 1.6mm </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay, so to do this, Imma need to:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Start with Joshua's in-class box.</li>
        <li>Grab a side, make it skinny so it becomes a spar.</li>
        <li>Grab a slot, shorten it so it can be used in an airfoil.</li>
        <li>
          Make some spars with my HW3 Grashopper files. No fillets in
          Grashopper; add them in OnShape.
        </li>
        <li>Make an airfoil with slots in Grashopper, also no fillets.</li>
        <li>Harmonize all the geometry in OnShape.</li>
        <li>Run the OnShape -> Bantam workflow.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        About that Worflow; time to view that in-class video capture.

            <li>
              Ignore the <strong>Top</strong> value. Bantam needs it to be there,

        My biggest worry is the airfoil.  It's got a pointy trailind edge, so
        I'm worried Bantam might kick up a fuss with the tool paths.  Time to
        fail fast and get a simple foil into Bantam ASAP.

        Rummage through previous homewoks, find a simple airfoil, pull into
        OnShape. Turns out 3dm's import just fine.   Here's one from Homwork
        3, just need to whack out that rectangle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Extrude the airfoil by 1.87mm, matching my FR1's thickness ... not working.
        OnShape doesn't seem to acknowledge the imported 3DM as a legit curve.
      </p>

      <p>
        Try Rhino. Can't really find a clean airfoil with no notches, so go back
        to
        <a href ="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/GarethPaterson">
          Dr. Gareth Paterson's

          NACA series 4 airfoil Generator (Grashopper Definition)
        </a>
        from Homework 3.  Fiddle with the inputs again until I get something
        thick, no unusual curves, but still a recognizeable airfoil shape.

        <figcaption>Nevermind, let's create a new one.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Now there's a couple things to try.  I could go direct to DXF from
        Rhino, pull into KiCad and Bantam.  That'll let me validate tool paths
        the fastest. Later, I'll try a Rhino -> OnShape -> KiCAD->Bantam workflow
        so I can do all the part-fitting and fillet-cutting in OnShape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interesting.  It says <em>Marked Areas need a smaller tool</em> but
        it <em>looks</em> like it will cut just fine (or close enough, anyway).
      </p>

        <figcaption>Hmm .....</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Zooming in, it looks like may airfoil picked up some "jaggies" (aliasing)
        during the imports and exports.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Uh-oh .... jaggies.</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>
        Go back to KiCAD ... looks pretty smooth there.  Try plotting from
        KiCAD again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going back to Rhino, the airfoil looks smooth.  Retry the export, there's
        more than one scheme avaialble.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Try <strong>CAM Metric</strong>, pull it through KiCAD then Bantam. No
        more warnings.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Still jaggies, but no warnings .. I'll take it.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Getting Iterative</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, so I'm feeling confident I can get Bantam to cut me an airfoil.
        Rather than cutting a solid foil that can't be used, I wanna print the
        minimal number of parts that validate airofoil shape as well as assembling
        foils and spars. Two foils, two spars, Joshua-Style joinery will will
        prove out all I'm looking to prove, and could be a MVA (Minimally Viable
        Assingment) in a pinch.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw05-pic10-sketch03.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Two Airfoils, two spars, good enough.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Right then, off to OnShape!
      </p>

      <h3>Pull in the Airfoil</h3>
      <p>
        Let's grab that CAM Metric dxf that worked so well in Bantam, and see
        if I can make an OnShape Part out of it.  Interesting, it came in red
        on black
      </p>

        <figcaption>What the ... </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        A little <a href ="https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/translation.htm">googling</a>
        tells me I'll probably have better luck importing the Rhino 3DM file.
        Having the same trouble getting from curve to extrusion though. Lemme
        try extruding in Rhino.
      </p>

        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw05-pic12-rhino-airfoil-extruded.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>Oh good, I remembered how to do this. </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This is encouraging.  Onshape recognizes it as a Part. Now let's see
        if I can get the airfoil part and Joshua's box parts to play nice in
        the same assembly.  Yeah.... Imma need to separate some aprts.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw05-pic13-airfoil-box-assembly.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>It kinda worked.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, after fumbling around with the mouseology, I managed to grab the
        sketch of Joshua's box top and paste into the part studio of my airfoil.
        Now I can (hopefuly) Grab one of his slots, shorten it, and cut a hole
        or two into my airfoil.  I might-just wanna larger airofoil, actually.

        I dunno ... it's not really working because the airfoil is a part, a
        curve, but not a sketch.  I'mma put the holes in with Rhino ... nah,

      <h3>Make a Spar</h3>
      <p>
        This <em>should</em> be as easy as taking Joshua's box-side and
        shrinking a dimension or two. But first, some measurements.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Joshua's slot length is <strong>26 mm</strong> from one arc-center to
          the next.

          <figure>

            <figcaption>Original slot length.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          Joshua's notch width is <strong>24 mm</strong> across,
          not counting the fillets.

          <figure>

            <figcaption>Original notch width.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          Joshua's fillets are <strong>1 mm.</strong> Looks like these will come
          free if I copy his part.

          <figure>

            <figcaption>Original fillets.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The key thing here, is that the slot is 2 mm longer than the notch. So
        we probably wanna 4 mm slot with a 2mm notch. Then, we gotta ...
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with Joshua's box side</li>
        <li>reduce slot halfwidth from 12 to 1</li>
        <li>reduce overall side with from NN to YY</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Turns out all the sketches and dimensions in Joshua's box are inter-realted
        to each other.  First, shrink his slot lenghts on his Sketch 1down to 4mm.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Shrunken slot lengths.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Next, Fiddle with Sketch1 side lenth and slot-to-edge distance to make
        the smallest box possible.  Baslically side length can go down to 9mm
        and slot-to-edge can go down to 1.57/2 + 0.1 before anything breaks too
        badly.

      <p>
        Moving on to box sides (Sketch2). Shrink the noth half-length from 12 mm
        down to 2.  The rest of the side got "skinny" after shrinking Sketch1.

        Now it's a matter of parts-wrangling in assembly mode. Forget the pin
        and slot mating, forget the fancy-shmancy part-level transforms.  Imma
        just grab, move, rotate until it looks about right.

        Hmm .. those aft spar slots (near the pointy end of the airfoils) don't
        look like they're going to leave much material behind, but let's take
        them into Bantam to see what it says.

      <h2>DAY FOUR: Milling at the MILL</h2>
      <p>
        Took another day off, I'm such a hedonist. So it almost worked last time.
        I got airfoils, spars, but no slots for the spars to fit into. After some
        thrashing around, i figured out I simply had left <strong>Holes</strong>
        turned off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imma use the same piece I milled last time, which means I need to offset
        my KiCAD plot so I don't re-mill what I had before. About <strong>32 mm</strong>
        should do it. The good news is, I don't need to re-mill the spars; I just
        need new airfoils. Save more time & material.

      <h3>Ah, Crap</h3>

        </figure>

        The parts came out with some persuasion and a utility knife. It <em>looks</em>
        like my notch and slot will work if properly milled.

          <figcaption>Maybe?</figcaption>
        </figure>


        Okay, so last time I told Bantam my <strong>Material</strong>
        had a <strong>Z Offset</strong> of <strong>1.56 mm</strong>, causing the mill
        to stop before cutting all the way through. So if I tell Bantam my material
        is <em>lower</em> it should cut <em>deeper.</em>  It's pretty hard to get
        a caliper reading, on the layer that was left behind. I'm getting something
        like <strong>0.34 mm.</strong>  I want this to go through, so Imma round up
        to <strong>0.4mm, </strong> bringing my new  <strong>Materia Z Offset</strong>
        to <strong>1.1mm</strong>
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h3>Back to Bantam</h3>
      <p>
        Start with a fresh FR1 sandwitch. Reload the Gerber file with all the
        airfoils and spars. Set <strong>Materia Z Offset</strong>
        to <strong>1.1mm</strong> and cut again. Use the same full-tape for <thead>
          "sandwitch meat" but do a simple "Union Jack" pattern for the surface that
          tapes to the aluminum bed.
        </p>

        <h3>AGAAIN !?!?!</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Another</em> cut-though failure! Wait a sec.  I changed
          <strong>Material <em>Thickness</em></strong>; I should be changing
          <strong>Material <em>Z-Offest</em></strong>. Let's. Try. Again. Set the
          <strong>Material Thickness</strong> to <strong>1.65</strong> (lie a little
          and say it's thicker than it really is); Set the <strong>Material Z Offset</strong>
          to <strong>1.5</strong> (lie a little and say it's not as high off of the
          base plate as it really is).

        <p>
          Uh-oh, loose parts. That'll teach me to try re-using the "sandwitch tape"
          from a prior run.
        </p>

        </figure>



        <h3>It Kinda worked</h3>
        <p>
          The parts came out, give or take a ding or two. They fit together, although
          they're loose.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Finshed(?)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>How Would I do Better?</h3>
        <p>
          The notches are ok, the slot lenghts are ok, the slot widths are too loose.
          Caliper says the notch is 1.30mm thick, while the slot is 1.37mm. Onshape
          says the Slots were to be 1.6mm thick. If I set my caliper for 1.59, I can't
          even fit it into the slot.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I'm kinda flying blind.  I could make a big long "fake airfoil" with a
          bunch of slots, all the same length, but gradually smaller widths. Step
          down 0.02 per slot maybe.

          Hm. The thought occurs that I may have been able to save some time and
          tool wear by skipping the rectangluar outline and just cutting the slot
          holes. Or maybe somehting I'm not considering at themoment would convince
          me that would be terrible idea if I tried it.  I'm just gonna let the
          mill run and work on my write-up.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh, great; something unexpected and unfortunate happened again.  None
          of my slots fit particularly well.  Upon closer inspection the slot
          widths on the top (copper side) ....

          Rig up and try (yet) again. This time I'll do slots only, no rectangle.
          whack the rectangle out in KiCAD, re-plot for Bantam. Add a y-offset
          of <strong>21.1 mm</strong> so the slots will land in an open spot of
          my (heavily used) material.

          Forget about Joshua's origiinal slot width.  Measure my actual material
          and go from there. Measure both ends of both spars. I'm getting
          <strong>1.28 mm, 1.29 mm, 1.30 mm</strong>. Prior slot tester started
          at <strong>1.6 mm</strong> and dropped down to <strong>1.4 mm</strong>
          (which just-barely holds) stepping <strong>0.02 mm</strong> each time.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I really want to do is have a midpoint of <strong>1.29 mm</strong>
          and step it by <strong> 0.01 mm </strong> each direction.
