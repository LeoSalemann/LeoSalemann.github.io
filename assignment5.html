    <div id="day-01">
      <h2>DAY ONE: Get my FAQ's Straight</h2>
      <p>
        The assignment says "box" but the FAQ's say any 3d object made of
        milled parts will do. So my good ol' wing with airfoils and spars
        should do just fine.
      </p>

      <h3>Avoid Abuse With Strategic Re-Use</h3>
      <p>
        I've got my Grashopper scripts for generating airfoils and spars. They
        can be easily scaled down to fit on the FR-1. I'll need to be less
        cavalier about cut-outs, though -- none of this extra rectangle crap.
        I'll probably use OnShape for righteous airfoil cut outs, chamfers,
        and fillets.
      </p>

      <h3>Hmmm Box Wings Are Actually a Thing</h3>

      <p>
        This is where I start to have terrible complicated ideas that I abandon
        for something that's actually achievable.  So "box" and "wing" aren't
        mutually exclusive.  They exist in concept, and I believe a few small
        examples have flown.
      </p>

          </a>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        But anyway, making one of these from the get-go is a terrible idea that
        would put my whole assignment at risk. So I'll get a conventional wing
        to exist first, then see if there's time left.
      </p>

      <h3> What was the Plan Again?</h3>
      <p>
        Dropping the Reality Distortion Field, an actual plan would be something
        like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Review in-class videos to make sure I know what I'm doing.</li>
        <li>Pull some wings and airfoils from Grashopper into OnShape.</li>
        <li>Build righteous tool paths in OnShape.</li>
        <li>
          Run the OnShape -> Bantam Mill workflow like a normal person for a
          change.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there's any time and material left (yeah, right) get weird and boxy
          with it.
        </li>

      <h2>DAY TWO: Sketch It! Sketch It Good!</h2>
      <p>
        Took a day off yesterday, got some ideas on how to reuse/repurpose the
        in-class box demo. It's all about slots and notches. I can reuse the slots
        in my airfoils, and the notches in some between-foil spars.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll probalby need to do the same "notch into notch" technique I used
        in my carboard wings. The key dimension here is slot width <strong>w</strong>
        (below). If I can
        <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ASSUME%20%28ass%20u%20me%29">
          <em>assume</em>
        </a>
        that the in-class box demo will indeed product a snug-fitting box, then
        the widths of the slots should be the <strong>w</strong> I need.
      </p>

        <img src ="img/hcde598-hw05-pic02-sketch02.png" width=400>
        <figcaption>I hope this slot width works.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        A little poking around with the OnShape file tells me
        <strong>w = 1.6mm </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay, so to do this, Imma need to:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Start with Joshua's in-class box.</li>
        <li>Grab a side, make it skinny so it becomes a spar.</li>
        <li>Grab a slot, shorten it so it can be used in an airfoil.</li>
        <li>
          Make some spars with my HW3 Grashopper files. No fillets in
          Grashopper; add them in OnShape.
        </li>
        <li>Make an airfoil with slots in Grashopper, also no fillets.</li>
        <li>Harmonize all the geometry in OnShape.</li>
        <li>Run the OnShape -> Bantam workflow.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        About that Worflow; time to view that in-class video capture.

      <h3>Key Learnings of Video Make Benefit Glorious Homework Assignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>During KiCAD Import, use <strong>Edge Cuts</strong> layer.</li>
        <li>Set an origin with <strong>Place Auxilliary Axis Origin.</strong></li>
        <li>You can import multiple DWG's into one KiCAD project.</li>
        <li>
          You can draw out the FR1 outline so you know how many parts you can
          lay up at once.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <strong>File > Plot</strong> to export.

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          When importing into Bantam Tools you need to do a <strong>hack.</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Set <strong>Outline></strong> to the gerber file.</li>
            <li>
              Ignore the <strong>Top</strong> value. Bantam needs it to be there,
              so accept it and be tolerant.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          There's also some normal Bantam Tool settings to fiddle with.
          <ul>
            <li>Uncheck <strong>Traces.</strong></li>
            <li>Material: <strong>Generic.</strong></li>
            <li>Measure youre material thinkness.</li>
            <li>
              Placement Z = material + double-side tape. Measure a single; make a
              tape sandwich, measure the sandwich, subtract.
            </li>
            <li>Probalby gonna stick with 1/32 in end mill.</li>
            <li>
              In OnShape, use fillete. Make "notch length" short enough to
              accomodate them.

        My biggest worry is the airfoil.  It's got a pointy trailind edge, so
        I'm worried Bantam might kick up a fuss with the tool paths.  Time to
        fail fast and get a simple foil into Bantam ASAP.

      <p>
          Rummage through previous homewoks, find a simple airfoil, pull into
          OnShape. Turns out 3dm's import just fine.   Here's one from Homwork
          3, just need to whack out that rectangle.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Let's try this one from Assingment 3.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Extrude the airfoil by 1.87mm, matching my FR1's thickness ... not working.
        OnShape doesn't seem to acknowledge the imported 3DM as a legit curve.
      </p>

      <p>
        Try Rhino. Can't really find a clean airfoil with no notches, so go back
        to
        <a href ="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/GarethPaterson">
          Dr. Gareth Paterson's
        </a>

        <a href ="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/profiles/blogs/naca-series-4-aerofoil-generator">
          NACA series 4 airfoil Generator (Grashopper Definition)
        </a>
        from Homework 3.  Fiddle with the inputs again until I get something
        thick, no unusual curves, but still a recognizeable airfoil shape.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Nevermind, let's create a new one.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
          Now there's a couple things to try.  I could go direct to DXF from
          Rhino, pull into KiCad and Bantam.  That'll let me validate tool paths
          the fastest. Later, I'll try a Rhino -> OnShape -> KiCAD->Bantam workflow
          so I can do all the part-fitting and fillet-cutting in OnShape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interesting.  It says <em>Marked Areas need a smaller tool</em> but
        it <em>looks</em> like it will cut just fine (or close enough, anyway).

        <figcaption>Hmm .....</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Zooming in, it looks like may airfoil picked up some "jaggies" (aliasing)
        during the imports and exports.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Uh-oh .... jaggies.</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>
        Go back to KiCAD ... looks pretty smooth there.  Try plotting from
        KiCAD again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going back to Rhino, the airfoil looks smooth.  Retry the export, there's
        more than one scheme avaialble.

      <p>
        Try <strong>CAM Metric</strong>, pull it through KiCAD then Bantam. No
        more warnings.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h3>Getting Iterative</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, so I'm feeling confident I can get Bantam to cut me an airfoil.
        Rather than cutting a solid foil that can't be used, I wanna print the
        minimal number of parts that validate airofoil shape as well as assembling
        foils and spars. Two foils, two spars, Joshua-Style joinery will will
        prove out all I'm looking to prove, and could be a MVA (Minimally Viable
        Assingment) in a pinch.
